FRENCH_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the death of Napoleon III in 1873, Napoleon IV in 1898, Napoleon V in 1926, Napoleon VI took over and promulgated a constitution, more liberal than the previous. Riding high on support gained from this, he has ruled justly and fostered a strong emigre community and a sense of nationalism in the people. After the German Revolution of 1930, France annexed the Rhineland, and the combination of these two factors has made Napoleon VI highly popular. As France gears up for war with the fascists, the Empire of Austria, and the British, Napoleon VI serves as a rallying point for Frenchmen everywhere. Vive la France!"

NAPOELEON_DESC:0 "Louis Jerome Victor Emmanuel Leopold Marie, or Napoleon VI, has led an interesting life. Born in Paris in 1914 on the eve of the Europakrieg, his formative years were spent looking at the damage to Europe from that war. His aversion to the vicious slaughter contrasted sharply with the family’s penchant for warmongering. With his father busy running the country, his nanny until age 6 was the ancient Dowager Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III the Restorer. After her death in 1920, Louis was sent off to the prestigious Leuven Elementary School. His education was interrupted by the death of his father in 1926, causing the regency of the Empress Clementine. His tutor during these years was esteemed liberal politician Gaston Domergue, and after ascending the throne in 1929, Domergue’s influence caused the Emperor to sign the Constitution of 1927, which made male adult suffrage near universal and expanded the right to protest, though the Emperor was still the central figure of the Constitution. Shortly after this, Napoleon was shocked when he faced the Rocque Putsch, led by Colonel Francois de la Rocque and right-wing officers opposed to the Constitution. While well respected Field Marshal Phillipe Petain decried the insurrection, he is well known to have sympathy for de la Rocque. Napoleon’s anger knew no bounds when he heard that de la Rocque’s men had shot Domergue, who the Emperor had appointed Prime Minister. The aggrieved Emperor angered Petain by ordering the conspirators to be summarily shot. The loss of Domergue caused Napoleon to retreat from politics and made him question the Constitution he had agreed to, especially after the rise of the SFIO and Radical Party. The Emperor’s political hiatus ended in 1933 when, fearing the defeat of his friend and Prime Minister Pierre Laval’s government, he personally appealed to the French people to support Laval. The Emperor’s popularity caused a decisive win for Laval, but alienated the Radicals and Socialists to the point where they formed the Cartel de Gauche to oppose Laval, and extremism heightened, with the Dowager Empress Clementine almost being assassinated by an anarchist. The Emperor wanted to restore the 1852 Constitution, but he was unable to because Edouard Daladier’s left wing of the Doctrinaire (popularly referred to as the Dynastic Left) threatened to join the Cartel if such a move was taken. Since the withdrawal of the Dynastic Left would destroy the Doctrinaire majority, the Emperor was unable to restore his old powers. Parliament became ever more fractious, and while the Emperor had been infuriated at the Rocque Putsch, he now reconciled with the Marechal, and right wing officers have joined the Emperor’s inner circle. The issue of the refugees has become ever more problematic, with the Emperor officially undecided. Though his tumultuous life and reign had forced him to grow up fast, he is still just 22 and could easily change his position. As the cracks spread in the Empire and in Europe, the Emperor is sure of one thing: the Bonapartes will never surrender."

francestart.1.d:0 "French lore go brrrr" 
francestart.1.a:0 "Election Season is upon us"

francestart.2.t:0 "The Issue of Refugees"
francestart.2.d:0 "France's Refugee Issue is a complex situation made up of four main groups: Poles, Italians, Hungarians, and Prussians; \nPolish Legions are hardcore soldiers (and families) who are personally loyal to the Bonaparte dynasty but somewhat liberal (constitutionalists); they dislike Prussian exiles, are neutral towards Italian liberals, and have a love-hate relationship with Hungarian revolutionaries.\nPrussian exiles, mostly conservative officers, are loyal to the Doctrinaire party, but despise Poles, Italian liberals and are moderate against Hungarian revolutionaries.\nItalian liberals, most of them are officially liberals though some are secretly anarchists, are sympathetic to liberal republicans and the SFIO; They support Hungarians, dislike Prussians, and are neutral towards Poles.\nHungarian revolutionaries, across the ideological spectrum but generally social democrats aligned with the Leftist Coalition, are fiercely committed to self-determination for all nations; they have a love-hate relationship with the Polish exiles (liberal nationalist brothers and historical friendship, but ideological divergences), support the Italian liberals, and are moderately against Prussian exiles."
francestart.2.a:0 "We Must Choose A Side"

francestart.3.t:0 "The Refugee Bill was rejected"
francestart.3.d:0 "Today, Napoleon walked outside of the Imperial Senate building in Paris and announced that the Refugee Bill to give voting rights to the Hungarians and Italians was struck down. This likely means that the Doctrinaires will prevail in Imperial Elections, with mainly French Conservatives participating."
francestart.3.a:0 "No Civil Rights? Based."

francestart.4.t:0 "The Refugee Bill was accepted"
francestart.4.d:0 "Today, Napoleon walked outside of the Imperial Senate building in Paris and announced that the Refugee Bill to give voting rights to the Hungarians and Italians was accepted by the Senate. This likely means that the Popular Front will prevail in Imperial Elections, with huge surge of SS Leftist Members allowed to vote."
francestart.4.a:0 "Civil Rights? Based."

francestart.5.t:0 "Napoleon Denounces the Left"
francestart.5.d:0 "Napoleon walked up the podium. It had been a long day campaigning for the Doctrinaire Party, and he had just finished giving a speech on why France should elect Charles Maurras as mayor of Paris.\n\nHe started of his speech saying how well the French had propsered under the rule of the Napoleons, as well as naming all the economic and political reforms that had made France a better country. Next, he gave a passionate speech about how the Left SS Coalition would wreck the country and raise debt. The people cheered him as he climbed down from the podium and into his car. "
francestart.5.a:0 "The Doctrinaires must win!"

francestart.6.t:0 "Napoleon Visits Factories"
francestart.6.d:0 "Napoleon stepped into the inner city car factory right outside Paris' city center, the smell of gunk and sweat overwhelming his senses. As much as he knew these types of workers would flock to the caolition, maybe he could sway some of them in the Doctrinaires favor to secure a good majority. He shook hands with some of the workers, covered in tar and grease. After talking with the head of the factory, he headed to his car cheered on by the workers."
francestart.6.a:0 "A Man of the People!"

francestart.7.t:0 "Napoleon increases his power"
francestart.7.d:0 "Napoleon grabbed his pen and signed the decree. The decree, which would give him and his Doctrinaires more power, was decried by the left as "totalitarian and "a cracdown on liberty". He had coined it "protection" from the radical Jacobins and peasantry, but in reality he knew these measures would secure his rule."
francestart.7.a:0 "Napoleon Rules All!"

francestart.8.t:0 "Napoleon Increases His Power"
francestart.8.d:0 "Today Napoleon signed a decree giving himself more power.  The decree, which would give him and his Doctrinaires near absolute rule, was decried by the left as "totalitarian and "a cracdown on liberty". He had coined it "protection" from the radical Jacobins and peasantry, but many question whether he thought these measures would secure his rule."
