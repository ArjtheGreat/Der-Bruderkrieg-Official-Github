After the Civil Service Ban by the ruling ARP-LSP centrist coalition prevented any Patriot governments from ever forming, the Jaocbins launched a coup and subsequent fall of the Dutch government started the Dutch Civil War. The Dutch East Indies also collapsed into various factions, with the war ongoing in Indonesia as well."
