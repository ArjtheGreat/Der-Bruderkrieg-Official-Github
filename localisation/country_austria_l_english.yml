AUSTRIA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Austro-Prussian War ended in 1868. Our glorious victory proved absolutism to be the right path. After defending the liberty of the South German states, we thought it only right that they reorganize themselves to our liking. The Prussians tried again to beat us along the the traitorous Italians and Russians, but failed to do so as our nation managed a stalemate against all odds. But the separatists still hadn't learn their lesson. In 1923, the Magyars revolted, soaking the Empire in blood for 3 years. But we triumphed yet again, and spread absolutism. By now, though, opposition has reached a breaking point between the Czechs, Italians and Hungarians. The Empire is in chaos, but Austria erit in orbe ultima."
 

####Party names
KARL_DESC:0 "Karl I, His Serene Highness, Emperor of Austria, was born in the castle of Persenbeug in 1887. He was the Emperor Franz Joseph’s great nephew and the future heir, Archduke Franz Ferdinand's nephew. Only 2 when Crown Prince Rudolf - Uncle Rudi - committed suicide in 1889, Karl’s childhood was pampered initally, but after the death of Archduke Karl Ludwig, Karl was second-in-line for the throne. Raised by his aging great-uncle personally, Karl developed a reactionary, military attitude, pleasing the emperor greatly as he had been raised in a similar fashion. After the Chotek Scandal in 1899, Franz Ferdinand, deeply in love with Countess Sophie Chotek, married without the Emperor’s consent, and, pleased with Karl’s upbringing and infuriated at Franz’s insolence, the Emperor disinherited Franz Ferdinand, making Karl his heir. Karl was also staunchly Catholic. The same year, he met his future wife, Zita of Bourbon-Parma, though they were both children. The next year, Karl visited Hungary, and was greeted warmly as most Hungarians preferred Karl to Franz Ferdinand, who they disliked. Karl was enrolled as an officer in the Imperial Army, and seemed headed for a long, absolutist career. He was married to Zita in 1911, and she gave birth to Otto in 1912. Then came the war.\nKarl frequently clashed with Conrad von Hotzendorf, but since in the military his only allies were Croats, he was isolated by the Austrian noble high command. Conrad convinced the aging emperor that the heir should not be on the front lines and Karl was recalled, just in time for Franz Joseph to die in 1916. Karl reconciled with Franz Ferdinand and his Slavophile party, sending his uncle to the Bavarian front while he consolidated political support. Through his widespread popularity as a new emperor, he was able to maintain Imperial stability and conclude a decent peace. In the wake of the defeat, Karl used his Slavophile backing to reform the army, expelling the incompetent Austrian nobility such as Hotzendorf. Though many hoped that Karl would then reform the Empire in a liberal direction, he reformed the absolutist system, making it more Catholic and meritocratic. The government was not corrupt or inefficient, nor was the army, but Karl’s popularity sank outside of Austria and Croatia. In Hungary, this decline was so precipitous, owing to the Emperor’s support for minority nationalities with the Crown of St. Stephen, that a full-blown revolution began in 1923, lasting until 1926. The war killed 300,000 people and devastated Hungary further, but did prove the effectiveness of the reformed Austrian army. Karl also gained critical support from Slovak cleric Jozef Tizo and Croatian liberal Stjepan Radic, a rabid anti-Hungarian, though Karl was forced to concede large-scale autonomy for both regions. Karl sought a path which would ensure the system’s effectiveness without threatening its stability, and thus won anger from the nobility and minorities alike. He was beloved by the Austrian people though, for his Catholic Social programs and his education reforms. In response to the assassination of Minister of the Interior Kurt Schussnigg by a Czech nationalist, Karl closed the Bohemian Diet, provoking angry protests. Austria seems ready to explode, but Karl has never shied from decisive action. Karl leads Austria through these chaotic times."

 GroBosterreich:0 "GroBosterreich"
 GroBosterreich_desc:0 "The Austrian Empire under the reign of the Habsburgs is the preeminent power of Europe. Through marriage, diplomacy, and war, Austria has ascended, gaining dynastic claim to Hungary and Bohemia, taking effective control of Germany and not relinquishing it to France or Prussia, and playing off the minorities against each other. All Austrians are filled with a patriotic love of the Kaiser, and hatred of the Prussians and Russians who dared try to strip our glory away. Austria erit in orbit ultima!"

 AUS_treaty_of_vienna:0 "The Treaty of Vienna"
 AUS_treaty_of_vienna_desc:0 "The Prussians tried to attack us once again in the Europa Krieg, and with the help of the Russians and Italians almost destroyed our great empire. But we fought back and managed to preserve the Habsburg Order over Europe, but not until they imposed strict regulations on our army and special weapons technology program. Over the years, as Russia turned into isolation and Italy and Prussia flew into chaos, we started rebuilding our army, but it is yet to reach its full potential. With the next Bruderkrieg incoming, we also need to update our advanced fighters and nuclear technology in case the world goes hayware. Everything is on the line, and this document must be rid of!"

 Absolutism:0 "Absolutism"
 Absolutism_desc:0 "The principle of absolutism is the centerpiece of the Empire and has been since Kaiser Joseph’s reign. While some carping liberals consider it to be contributing to the Empire’s decline it certainly has held us together for this long. The Monarchy has controlled Austria with an iron fist since the 1200s and the nobility are the only advisors it has needed. Populism was crushed in 1848 and it’s a plague on the Empire."

 Bohemian_Outrage:0 "Bohemian Outrage"
 Bohemian_Outrage_desc:0 "In 1934, our divine emperor Karl I von Habsburg shuttered the Bohemian Diet. The Bohemians have had a rocky past with Austria, after the Protestant Revolt triggered 30 years of bloodshed. Since 1848, the Bohemians were graciously allowed by Kaiser Franz Joseph to have their diet, and in return it promoted sedition, so he justly closed it. Bohemians are in an uproar, and the whole area is on the brink of revolution. Nationalist traitors abound and we must tread carefully to avoid provoking a violent response."

 Nemetzi_dal:0 "Nemzeti dal"
 Nemetzi_dal_desc:0 "Ever since we generously freed Hungary from Turkish subjugation, they have traitorously tried to backstab their King. First the traitor nobles like Imre Thokoly and Ferenc Rakcozi, then radical revolutionaries in 1848 and 1923 like Lajos Kossuth, Sandor Petofi, Mihaly Karolyi, and Bela Kun. Petofi is particularly hated by Austrians for his traitor’s hymn, the National Song. Commemorating the Maygar insurrections, the song is banned but widely loved in Hungary to represent 400 years of “oppression”."

The cursed green white and red tricolor waves above their houses no matter the punishment, and our economy is in shambles thanks to their perfidious influence."

An economic crash is most likely soon to come as our economy continues to stagnate in terms of growth as our economy continues to get worse as it seems. Wien, the economical capital of Europe is at risk of being dethroned and being replaced with any other city. We must keep an eye on this growth and attempt to put our economy back on track in order to ensure our position as the master of Europe."

The Austrian Empire, born in the ashes of the Napoleonic Wars, was dominating Europe outwardly. But inside, it was full of rot. The revolutions of 1848 nearly burned our empire to the ground, but Franz Joseph I, Der Alter Kaiser, saved us from revolution, though Hungary would continue to be a problem. After the treacherous Prussians backstabbed us to unite Germany, we put them and Italy down, seizing land and dominance in Germany. We were mortified to see ultranationalist regimes rise in both countries, and even more mortified when they, combined with Russia, invaded us and the Ottomans. We were pushed back almost to Vienna, but our skilled army, never wanting to bend to the Prussian scum, counterattacked with vengeance and saved the Empire. It was truly the old against the new, and while we nearly lost, we still stand as the preeminent power thanks to the Russian March Revolution and our forcing of a stalemate on Prussia. (Note - it would be March in Austrian calendar) We crushed Bela Kun’s traitorous revolution in Hungary in the 20s, but under the rule of Kaiser Karl I, the regionalist issues have begun to resurface. The Empire is buckling under the weight of its subjects, and with the storm clouds of war brewing, only time can tell whether our Empire will hold"

The atmosphere was full of liveliness and excitement, dampened only slightly by the certainty of informants. \n In one room, though, the atmosphere was markedly different. 5 men sat down to converse at the table. The barkeep came in. “Hope you enjoy your special accommodations,” then whispering, “We never saw each other.” The young man at the head of table nodded, and the barkeep exited. \n The man surveyed the other guests.

Being a man of good heart, Franz had never expressed any immediate jealousy over Karl's position, claiming "it was worth it for the love". But Karl knew secretly that Franz would have loved to rule Austria.\n\nAfter his father's death in 1916, Karl had been feeling sympathetic for his uncle. He chose to appoint him Prime Minister of the South German Confederation, hoping his charisma would help counter the very popular Wittelsbach House and balancing power in Austria's favor. So far, it had not worked to plan. Franz was looked at by the people and the military as a dictator because of his reforms. The court had been split into multple factions. Most called the SGC a measly "garrison state" of Austria. It had been a disaster since its formation post-Brudekrieg.\n\n"Hey, Mein Kaiser Karl! How are you doing?", Franz said, beckoning him inside."n\n"I'm doing well, Uncle. I hope things are better than the reports I have heard."\n\nFranz kept his silence as they strolled down the hallway, and Karl quickly changed the subject to Prussia and Italy.\n\nIt was clear the nation was on fire.

Sitting next to the king on the left was a man who looked at Franz with dislike. “His Majesty and Serene Highness, Emperor of Austria, Karl von Habsburg!” he was announced. He walked up and shook Rupprecht’s hand, as the other man’s glare intensified. Karl walked up to him. “Well met, sir,” he declaimed. “This is the Count von Rundstedt,” his aide whispered. I should have known, Karl thought. His debriefings had identified Rundstedt as a major rival to Austrian control. He would have to remember that.\n\nWith the Emperor introduced and taking a seat, the furious debate continued. One minister shouted angrily, “We are your allies, not your puppets!” Franz stood up and angrily demanded the man be sacked, prompting an outburst. Rundstedt stood up, gruffly stating that the army would stand behind their king.\n\nFranz stood up to reply, but Karl cut him off. “Of course, Count, the army will stand by their king. I would expect no less. I request the King to exert his authority over his subjects, which the Count von Rundstedt has so clearly reminded us of, to ensure a civil discourse.” Rupprecht stood up. “Yes, indeed, men, calm yourselves.” The old man took him aside.\n\n“Emperor, your - your ambassador, such as he is, is not fostering the unity of our 70 year alliance. I-I must insist that he moderate his tone or be recalled.” “Oh?” Karl wondered aloud. “What has the Archduke done to displease you, King?” “Man, did you not see the court?” the king demanded. So much for civil discourse, Karl thought. “Mind your tone, sir, or-” Or the army will mind it for you, Karl didn’t say. It was clear what he meant. The Emperor tried another tack. “You have been a good and faithful ally of the Empire for 70 years, as you said, and I assure you that all the Archduke wishes to accomplish is for the endurance of the alliance.” “Emperor,” Rupprecht said, in grudging acceptance of Karl’s tact, “He can fill the civil service and army with cronies, but not the people. You remember the Hungarian Revolution.” Watching Karl wince, he asked, “Do you want that in our land, in the Confederation I’ve sworn to defend?”\n\nKarl, shocked, said, “Surely it isn’t so bad.” In response, the old king escorted him to a window. He saw red flags, black flags, general anarchy, and worst of all, Prussian banners. “Mein Gott,” he said. Rupprecht heard, and responded, “Gott hilf uns.”"

There, the Czech marshal Snedjarek was waiting for him.\n\nKarl asked him about the stability of the Confederation, where he confirmed what Rupprecht had said. Franz looked sheepish, but the time for demanding answers from him wasn’t now. Instead, Karl looked at Snedjarek, saying, “You know the Prussians and the South Germans, and how they fight. If a large scale popular insurrection happened during a war with Prussia, do you think the army could fight them off?” He was hoping for a yes, but expecting what came next. Immediately Snedjarek and Rundstedt both stated that it would likely be impossible. Karl turned to the Count. “Count, what would you suggest be done?” Rundstedt answered promptly, with Karl thinking that he must be a good officer. “You must strengthen the local army and ensure it isn’t infiltrated, you must dismiss the good Archduke, institute social programs to appease the mob, and hunt down bandit rebels immediately. Do it quickly, Goring’s agents are already trying to infiltrate my exile units.” Karl turned to Franz Ferdinand, who bellowed angrily, “Nephew, dismissing me will be the end of Austrian power here! We are the senior partner in this alliance, and this will show weakness! It will cause more problems than it solves!”\n\nKarl turned to Snedjarek, who looked thoughtful. He was a conservative, but also a military officer and a pragmatist. He said, “I truly am not sure which course would be better, but my Emperor, you must choose between them. Allowing the Confederation to simply drift will lead to disaster.” Karl turned to all of them, and made the decision that would define the Confederation…"
