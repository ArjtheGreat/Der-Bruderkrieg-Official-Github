AUSTRIA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Austro-Prussian War ended in 1868. Our glorious victory proved absolutism to be the right path. After defending the liberty of the South German states, we thought it only right that they reorganize themselves to our liking. The Prussians tried again to beat us along the the traitorous Italians and Russians, but failed to do so as our nation managed a stalemate against all odds. But the separatists still hadn't learn their lesson. In 1923, the Magyars revolted, soaking the Empire in blood for 3 years. But we triumphed yet again, and spread absolutism. By now, though, opposition has reached a breaking point between the Czechs, Italians and Hungarians. The Empire is in chaos, but Austria erit in orbe ultima."


####Party names
KARL_DESC:0 "Karl I, His Serene Highness, Emperor of Austria, was born in the castle of Persenbeug in 1887. He was the Emperor Franz Joseph’s great nephew and the future heir, Archduke Franz Ferdinand's nephew. Only 2 when Crown Prince Rudolf - Uncle Rudi - committed suicide in 1889, Karl’s childhood was pampered initally, but after the death of Archduke Karl Ludwig, Karl was second-in-line for the throne. Raised by his aging great-uncle personally, Karl developed a reactionary, military attitude, pleasing the emperor greatly as he had been raised in a similar fashion. After the Chotek Scandal in 1899, Franz Ferdinand, deeply in love with Countess Sophie Chotek, married without the Emperor’s consent, and, pleased with Karl’s upbringing and infuriated at Franz’s insolence, the Emperor disinherited Franz Ferdinand, making Karl his heir. Karl was also staunchly Catholic. The same year, he met his future wife, Zita of Bourbon-Parma, though they were both children. The next year, Karl visited Hungary, and was greeted warmly as most Hungarians preferred Karl to Franz Ferdinand, who they disliked. Karl was enrolled as an officer in the Imperial Army, and seemed headed for a long, absolutist career. He was married to Zita in 1911, and she gave birth to Otto in 1912. Then came the war.\nKarl frequently clashed with Conrad von Hotzendorf, but since in the military his only allies were Croats, he was isolated by the Austrian noble high command. Conrad convinced the aging emperor that the heir should not be on the front lines and Karl was recalled, just in time for Franz Joseph to die in 1916. Karl reconciled with Franz Ferdinand and his Slavophile party, sending his uncle to the Bavarian front while he consolidated political support. Through his widespread popularity as a new emperor, he was able to maintain Imperial stability and conclude a decent peace. In the wake of the defeat, Karl used his Slavophile backing to reform the army, expelling the incompetent Austrian nobility such as Hotzendorf. Though many hoped that Karl would then reform the Empire in a liberal direction, he reformed the absolutist system, making it more Catholic and meritocratic. The government was not corrupt or inefficient, nor was the army, but Karl’s popularity sank outside of Austria and Croatia. In Hungary, this decline was so precipitous, owing to the Emperor’s support for minority nationalities with the Crown of St. Stephen, that a full-blown revolution began in 1923, lasting until 1926. The war killed 300,000 people and devastated Hungary further, but did prove the effectiveness of the reformed Austrian army. Karl also gained critical support from Slovak cleric Jozef Tizo and Croatian liberal Stjepan Radic, a rabid anti-Hungarian, though Karl was forced to concede large-scale autonomy for both regions. Karl sought a path which would ensure the system’s effectiveness without threatening its stability, and thus won anger from the nobility and minorities alike. He was beloved by the Austrian people though, for his Catholic Social programs and his education reforms. In response to the assassination of Minister of the Interior Kurt Schussnigg by a Czech nationalist, Karl closed the Bohemian Diet, provoking angry protests. Austria seems ready to explode, but Karl has never shied from decisive action. With an Address to the Empire upcoming, Karl will try to see his Empire through."

 GroBosterreich:0 "GroBosterreich"
 GroBosterreich_desc:0 "The Austrian Empire under the reign of the Habsburgs is the preeminent power of Europe. Through marriage, diplomacy, and war, Austria has ascended, gaining dynastic claim to Hungary and Bohemia, taking effective control of Germany and not relinquishing it to France or Prussia, and playing off the minorities against each other. All Austrians are filled with a patriotic love of the Kaiser, and hatred of the Prussians and Russians who dared try to strip our glory away. Austria erit in orbit ultima!"

 AUS_treaty_of_vienna:0 "The Treaty of Vienna"
 AUS_treaty_of_vienna_desc:0 "The Prussians tried to attack us once again in the Europa Krieg, and with the help of the Russians and Italians almost destroyed our great empire. But we fought back and managed to preserve the Habsburg Order over Europe, but not until they imposed strict regulations on our army and special weapons technology program. Over the years, as Russia turned into isolation and Italy and Prussia flew into chaos, we started rebuilding our army, but it is yet to reach its full potential. With the next Bruderkrieg incoming, we also need to update our advanced fighters and nuclear technology in case the world goes hayware. Everything is on the line, and this document must be rid of!"

 Absolutism:0 "Absolutism"
 Absolutism_desc:0 "The principle of absolutism is the centerpiece of the Empire and has been since Kaiser Joseph’s reign. While some carping liberals consider it to be contributing to the Empire’s decline it certainly has held us together for this long. The Monarchy has controlled Austria with an iron fist since the 1200s and the nobility are the only advisors it has needed. Populism was crushed in 1848 and it’s a plague on the Empire."

 Bohemian_Outrage:0 "Bohemian Outrage"
 Bohemian_Outrage_desc:0 "In 1934, our divine emperor Karl I von Habsburg shuttered the Bohemian Diet. The Bohemians have had a rocky past with Austria, after the Protestant Revolt triggered 30 years of bloodshed. Since 1848, the Bohemians were graciously allowed by Kaiser Franz Joseph to have their diet, and in return it promoted sedition, so he justly closed it. Bohemians are in an uproar, and the whole area is on the brink of revolution. Nationalist traitors abound and we must tread carefully to avoid provoking a violent response."

 Nemetzi_dal:0 "Nemzeti dal"
 Nemetzi_dal_desc:0 "Ever since we generously freed Hungary from Turkish subjugation, they have traitorously tried to backstab their King. First the traitor nobles like Imre Thokoly and Ferenc Rakcozi, then radical revolutionaries in 1848 and 1923 like Lajos Kossuth, Sandor Petofi, Mihaly Karolyi, and Bela Kun. Petofi is particularly hated by Austrians for his traitor’s hymn, the National Song. Commemorating the Maygar insurrections, the song is banned but widely loved in Hungary to represent 400 years of “oppression”."

The cursed green white and red tricolor waves above their houses no matter the punishment, and our economy is in shambles thanks to their perfidious influence."

An economic crash is most likely soon to come as our economy continues to stagnate in terms of growth as our economy continues to get worse as it seems. Wien, the economical capital of Europe is at risk of being dethroned and being replaced with any other city. We must keep an eye on this growth and attempt to put our economy back on track in order to ensure our position as the master of Europe."

DBK_austria_start.1.t:0 "The State of the Empire"
 DBK_austria_start.1.d:0 "Austria is a land in the middle of Europe. From it, the greatest Empire the world had ever known would rise. The Austrian Empire, born in the ashes of the Napoleonic Wars, was dominating Europe outwardly. But inside, it was full of rot. The revolutions of 1848 nearly burned our empire to the ground, but Franz Joseph I, Der Alter Kaiser, saved us from revolution, though Hungary would continue to be a problem. After the treacherous Prussians backstabbed us to unite Germany, we put them and Italy down, seizing land and dominance in Germany. We were mortified to see ultranationalist regimes rise in both countries, and even more mortified when they, combined with Russia, invaded us and the Ottomans. We were pushed back almost to Vienna, but our skilled army, never wanting to bend to the Prussian scum, counterattacked with vengeance and saved the Empire. It was truly the old against the new, and while we nearly lost, we still stand as the preeminent power thanks to the Russian March Revolution and our forcing of a stalemate on Prussia. (Note - it would be March in Austrian calendar) We crushed Bela Kun’s traitorous revolution in Hungary in the 20s, but under the rule of Kaiser Karl I, the regionalist issues have begun to resurface. The Empire is buckling under the weight of its subjects, and with the storm clouds of war brewing, only time can tell whether our Empire will hold"

The atmosphere was full of liveliness and excitement, dampened only slightly by the certainty of informants. \n In one room, though, the atmosphere was markedly different. 5 men sat down to converse at the table. The barkeep came in. “Hope you enjoy your special accommodations,” then whispering, “We never saw each other.” The young man at the head of table nodded, and the barkeep exited. \n The man surveyed the other guests. One man was tall, with the face and build of a wild man. His opposite was bald, with a face shaped like an egg. The third and fourth looked very alike, with square jaws, but most alike were their glares, pointed at each other. “Introductions?” the man at the head asked. “Pal Pronay,” the wild man answered. The bald man, looking with distrust at Pronay, responded, “Matyas Rakoczi.” The third man, never dropping his stare at the fourth, answered, “Ante Pavelic.” “Josip Broz,” stated the fourth man. “Wonderful, Karl Renner,” said the man. \n “So,” Pronay asked, “You’re our contact in the city?” \n “Not just contact, but assassin.”\n The men kept their surprise hidden well. Rakoczi asked, “You want to shoot the emperor?” Renner nodded. “Do you have the paper?” asked Pavelic. Renner, unfazed by the glare of the two Croats, took a document from inside his suit. “Read it,” Tito ordered. Renner began to speak."

Renner sighed, and continued.\n “The emperor is a tyrant. He has denied the most basic of rights to all his subjects. First among these is the right to be ruled by those you choose. Hungary and Croatia and all the other subjects under Karl’s heel never asked to be under it. No part of the Empire should be in this relic of a state. Karl needs to renounce his claims. \n Since it is clear he will never do so, he must go. We assassinate him for his oppression of the people of Austria, Hungary, Czechia, Slovakia, Transylvania - “ at this audible grumbling came from Pronay - “Germany, and Croatia. Let all people be ruled by their people alone. Death to tyrants, for the freedom of nations!” \n Tito nodded in satisfaction. “Much better,” chuckling, “If I had to listen to you for 1 hour - “ \n“Oh, be quiet,” Renner laughed. “The sooner the better, we only have a week.” \n As they left, the 4 guests wondered whether they would ever see Renner again. \n They’ll have to be ready at Stephensplatz."
