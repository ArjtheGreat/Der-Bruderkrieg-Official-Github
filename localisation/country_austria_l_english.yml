AUSTRIA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Austro-Prussian War ended in 1868. Our glorious victory proved absolutism to be the right path. After defending the liberty of the South German states, we thought it only right that they reorganize themselves to our liking. The Prussians tried again to beat us along the the traitorous Italians and Russians, but failed to do so as our nation managed a stalemate against all odds. But the separatists still hadn't learn their lesson. In 1923, the Magyars revolted, soaking the Empire in blood for 3 years. But we triumphed yet again, and spread absolutism. By now, though, opposition has reached a breaking point between the Czechs, Italians and Hungarians. The Empire is in chaos, but Austria erit in orbe ultima."

 GroBosterreich:0 "GroBosterreich"
 GroBosterreich_desc:0 "The Austrian Empire under the reign of the Habsburgs is the preeminent power of Europe. Through marriage, diplomacy, and war, Austria has ascended, gaining dynastic claim to Hungary and Bohemia, taking effective control of Germany and not relinquishing it to France or Prussia, and playing off the minorities against each other. All Austrians are filled with a patriotic love of the Kaiser, and hatred of the Prussians and Russians who dared try to strip our glory away. Austria erit in orbit ultima!"

 AUS_treaty_of_vienna:0 "The Treaty of Vienna"
 AUS_treaty_of_vienna_desc:0 "The Prussians tried to attack us once again in the Europa Krieg, and with the help of the Russians and Italians almost destroyed our great empire. But we fought back and managed to preserve the Habsburg Order over Europe, but not until they imposed strict regulations on our army and special weapons technology program. Over the years, as Russia turned into isolation and Italy and Prussia flew into chaos, we started rebuilding our army, but it is yet to reach its full potential. With the next Bruderkrieg incoming, we also need to update our advanced fighters and nuclear technology in case the world goes hayware. Everything is on the line, and this document must be rid of!"

 Absolutism:0 "Absolutism"
 Absolutism_desc:0 "The principle of absolutism is the centerpiece of the Empire and has been since Kaiser Joseph’s reign. While some carping liberals consider it to be contributing to the Empire’s decline it certainly has held us together for this long. The Monarchy has controlled Austria with an iron fist since the 1200s and the nobility are the only advisors it has needed. Populism was crushed in 1848 and it’s a plague on the Empire."

 Bohemian_Outrage:0 "Bohemian Outrage"
 Bohemian_Outrage_desc:0 "In 1934, our divine emperor Karl I von Habsburg shuttered the Bohemian Diet. The Bohemians have had a rocky past with Austria, after the Protestant Revolt triggered 30 years of bloodshed. Since 1848, the Bohemians were graciously allowed by Kaiser Franz Joseph to have their diet, and in return it promoted sedition, so he justly closed it. Bohemians are in an uproar, and the whole area is on the brink of revolution. Nationalist traitors abound and we must tread carefully to avoid provoking a violent response."

 Nemetzi_dal:0 "Nemzeti dal"
 Nemetzi_dal_desc:0 "Ever since we generously freed Hungary from Turkish subjugation, they have traitorously tried to backstab their King. First the traitor nobles like Imre Thokoly and Ferenc Rakcozi, then radical revolutionaries in 1848 and 1923 like Lajos Kossuth, Sandor Petofi, Mihaly Karolyi, and Bela Kun. Petofi is particularly hated by Austrians for his traitor’s hymn, the National Song. Commemorating the Maygar insurrections, the song is banned but widely loved in Hungary to represent 400 years of “oppression”."

 Giovane_Italia:0 "Giovane Italia"
 Giovane_Italia_desc:0 "Since the insidious lie-peddling Italian Revolution in 1848, the secret societies of Italy coalesced around Mazzini’s Young Italy. This den of scoundrels showed their true colors by becoming rabid anarchists and assassinating the beloved Empress Elizabeth in 1898. The cursed green white and red tricolor waves above their houses no matter the punishment, and our economy is in shambles thanks to their perfidious influence."

 AUS_stagnant_economic_growth:0 "Stagnant Economic Growth"
 AUS_stagnant_economic_growth_desc:0 "The economy has continued to stagnate for the past year, and our financial advisors are getting worried. An economic crash is most likely soon to come as our economy continues to stagnate in terms of growth as our economy continues to get worse as it seems. Wien, the economical capital of Europe is at risk of being dethroned and being replaced with any other city. We must keep an eye on this growth and attempt to put our economy back on track in order to ensure our position as the master of Europe."

DBK_austria_start.1.t:0 "The State of the Empire"
 DBK_austria_start.1.d:0 "Austria is a land in the middle of Europe. From it, the greatest Empire the world had ever known would rise. The Austrian Empire, born in the ashes of the Napoleonic Wars, was dominating Europe outwardly. But inside, it was full of rot. The revolutions of 1848 nearly burned our empire to the ground, but Franz Joseph I, Der Alter Kaiser, saved us from revolution, though Hungary would continue to be a problem. After the treacherous Prussians backstabbed us to unite Germany, we put them and Italy down, seizing land and dominance in Germany. We were mortified to see ultranationalist regimes rise in both countries, and even more mortified when they, combined with Russia, invaded us and the Ottomans. We were pushed back almost to Vienna, but our skilled army, never wanting to bend to the Prussian scum, counterattacked with vengeance and saved the Empire. It was truly the old against the new, and while we nearly lost, we still stand as the preeminent power thanks to the Russian March Revolution and our forcing of a stalemate on Prussia. (Note - it would be March in Austrian calendar) We crushed Bela Kun’s traitorous revolution in Hungary in the 20s, but under the rule of Kaiser Karl I, the regionalist issues have begun to resurface. The Empire is buckling under the weight of its subjects, and with the storm clouds of war brewing, only time can tell whether our Empire will hold"

The atmosphere was full of liveliness and excitement, dampened only slightly by the certainty of informants. \n In one room, though, the atmosphere was markedly different. 5 men sat down to converse at the table. The barkeep came in. “Hope you enjoy your special accommodations,” then whispering, “We never saw each other.” The young man at the head of table nodded, and the barkeep exited. \n The man surveyed the other guests. One man was tall, with the face and build of a wild man. His opposite was bald, with a face shaped like an egg. The third and fourth looked very alike, with square jaws, but most alike were their glares, pointed at each other. “Introductions?” the man at the head asked. “Pal Pronay,” the wild man answered. The bald man, looking with distrust at Pronay, responded, “Matyas Rakoczi.” The third man, never dropping his stare at the fourth, answered, “Ante Pavelic.” “Josip Broz,” stated the fourth man. “Wonderful, Karl Renner,” said the man. \n “So,” Pronay asked, “You’re our contact in the city?” \n “Not just contact, but assassin.”\n The men kept their surprise hidden well. Rakoczi asked, “You want to shoot the emperor?” Renner nodded. “Do you have the paper?” asked Pavelic. Renner, unfazed by the glare of the two Croats, took a document from inside his suit. “Read it,” Tito ordered. Renner began to speak."

Renner sighed, and continued.\n “The emperor is a tyrant. He has denied the most basic of rights to all his subjects. First among these is the right to be ruled by those you choose. Hungary and Croatia and all the other subjects under Karl’s heel never asked to be under it. No part of the Empire should be in this relic of a state. Karl needs to renounce his claims. \n Since it is clear he will never do so, he must go. We assassinate him for his oppression of the people of Austria, Hungary, Czechia, Slovakia, Transylvania - “ at this audible grumbling came from Pronay - “Germany, and Croatia. Let all people be ruled by their people alone. Death to tyrants, for the freedom of nations!” \n Tito nodded in satisfaction. “Much better,” chuckling, “If I had to listen to you for 1 hour - “ \n“Oh, be quiet,” Renner laughed. “The sooner the better, we only have a week.” \n As they left, the 4 guests wondered whether they would ever see Renner again. \n They’ll have to be ready at Stephensplatz."
