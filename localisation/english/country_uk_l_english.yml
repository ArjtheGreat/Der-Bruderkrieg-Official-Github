  ALBERT_VICTOR:0 "H.R.M Albert I became King of the United Kingdom after the death of his father Edward VII in 1910. He led Britain as a shell shocked spectator of the Europakrieg, not only helping orchestrate the Pact of Atlantica but also the British Expeditionary Force to Hannover. In the years after, he oversaw years of hardline colonial rule over the empire, culminating in the collapse of the British Raj in 1930, the first large crisis of his leadership.  The lasting effects of syphillis coupled with rising conspiracies about potential insanity furthered the shocks sent through Albert after the Indian situation.\n\nAfter suffering through multiple incompetent governments with extremism rising on all sides, he formed the moderate National Government led by Lord Edward Halifax, former Viceroy of India. With the empire having been reformed from the top, the upcoming years will be a crucial ones for Albert, as support for his brother Prince George and his nephew Prince Edward rise among the ranks and the crucial elections of 1936 look to decide the fate of Britain for decades to come. Will Albert I live up to the legacy of his grandmother Victoria, or push Britain further into political instability and international shame?"

ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The United Kingdom, the world's most powerful empire, lies in shambles in 1936. In 1915, with the Europakrieg destroying Europe, we sent the Anglo Expedtionary Force to Hannover and signed the Pact of Atlantica, to uphold the Concert of Europe. Disaster struck in 1930 when rising tensions in the Raj led to Gandhi's assasination and subsequent Great Indian Revolt. The people turned against Westminister leading to Halifax's National Government in 1932, and the beginning of the Imperial Federation.\nWith the popular support of Britain never lower, the nation faces critical upcoming years. With war in Europe inching closer, could Britain's downfall be near?"

  ENG_pact_of_atlantica_desc:0 "In the midst of the chaos of the Europakrieg on June 15th, 1915, Prime Minister H.L. Samuel signed a pact of neutrality in all wars, wanting to have no business with the tyrannies of Europe. The largely anti-war populace of Britain would have no business with the petty feuds of continental Europe, but Minister of Navy Winston Churchill till took major steps during the war to support the Austrians, forcing a blockade of the Baltic Sea which would eventually lead to a hard fallout with Teddy Roosevelt's regime in America. Nevertheless, the Pact lasted throughout the Europakrieg, with Norway also signing when its neighbors Denmark and Sweden crumbled. To this day, the United Kingdom still hopes to be a bastion of liberty and peace in Europe and the world."

  ENG_broken_crown_jewel_desc:0 "On March 12th, 1930, Mahatma Gandhi and 300 others were shot marching to the shores of Dandhi. It would be one of our biggest mistakes in our long history.\n\nIndia was once our pride and joy. Pumping out riches for the British Empire which spanned the seas, a model of civilized native princes and the divide and rule strategy - truly a symbol for all Britannia! The Jewel in our Crown, India was always our priority number one. Now India has fallen. The Crown Jewel lies in the dust, with only a small loyalist force in Bengal, our first conquest, remaining loyal to the crown. The Empire is all the weaker for it, as it has broken our profits, our alliance with America, and our international credibility.\n\nBut the biggest thing it has destroyed is our morale and cohesion. Far-right Tories demand the resumption of war, far-left Union Laborists demand withdrawal and acceptance, with the National Government under Halifax caught in the middle. Meanwhile, the average Briton lives in poverty on the streets, disgusted or apathetic to democracy in Britain, having lost all hope of carrying the British torch forward. It is a dark night of the soul for Britain and for the Empire.\n\n§RUntil the Raj is recovered and united, our jewel shall remain shattered.§!"

  ENG_british_jingoism_desc:0 "The disgraceful display of the great Indian revolt has put Britain to shame, and has stirred up British jingoism and nationalism. Despite the majority of the populace being anti-war and non-interventionist, a small group of colonial bulldogs under the likes of Winston Churchill have tried to rouse up a bigger army on a journey to retake the Raj."


  ENG_federalism:0 "The Imperial Federation"
  ENG_federalism_desc:0 "With the current breakdown of the British Raj, we sought to reorganize its rule over our colonies. Some conservatives sought a tighter iron grip should help weaken nationalist movements in their colonies but some would argue that would only accelerate the issue. Thus an age old idea was brought forth once again: The Imperial Federation. A once abandoned idea could be the key to maintaining the Empire. Such an idea was not too alienating as such colonies like Australia, Canada and New Zealand ruled with their own local government with semi-independence, thus still contributing their armies, wealth and support. Such an idea to take it to the next level now seemed necessary to Imperial survival especially to keep up against the other powers of Europe. The Empire is in shambles, and Halifax's Imperial Federation might be our final hope."

The British government is planning the swift evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force to head back to the isles, to the dismay of the military and the King.\n\nThe international community has been left shocked by this decision, to see the once great British Empire leave their dynastic relatives ripe for Prussian conquest, thus paving the way for the rise of Prussia."
