  DBK_USA_DESC:0 "The last few decades have been a challenging few for the United States. After Teddy Roosevelt won re-election in 1912 with the Bull Moose, the US was supposed to embark upon creating a bright future, staying out of the Europakrieg. The US experienced a growing middle class under Roosevelt's progressive policies until Warren Harding's removal of regulations resulted in an economic collapse in 1924. Fast forward 12 years and after multiple failed attempts, incumbent president Huey Long thinks he may finally have the solution to the depression. Ridden with polio, economic ruin and the Dust Bowl, dark times may lay ahead for the United States."

  LONG_DESC:0 "Huey 'The Kingfish' Long was at one point a nobody from the rural town of Winnfield about 200 miles northwest of Baton Rouge. But Long didn't stay a nobody forever and very quickly became a well known figure in Louisiana. Long's law skills even caught the attention of WIlliam Howard Taft who said Long was 'the most brilliant lawyer who ever practiced before the United States Supreme Court.' His time as a lawyer saw the beginning of his never ending battle against the Standard oil company of Louisiana. In 1924 Long unsuccessfully ran for governor of Louisiana, although he became more well known and would still play a key role in the state's politics. In 1928 Long ran again with the slogan 'Every man a king' and won with the largest voter margin in Louisiana till that point. Long's leadership transformed the once isolated swamp communities of Louisiana to bustling towns connected with real paved roads. Long's policies of helping the common man boosted him to national stardom.\n\nLong became a political legend among average Americans and earned himself a seat on the democratic national committee. Long found himself popular among voters but alienated by the actual democrat party that was suffering a large division between moderate democrats led by Al Smith and Franklin D. Roosevelt, advocates of slight welfare, a moderate racial policy and isolationist foreign policy and wilsonian democrats led by William Gibbs McAdoo who follow the beliefs of former party figurehead and failed presidential candidate Woodrow Wilson who favored segregation, regulated economics and an interventionist foreign policy to create "a world safe for democracy" in the 1932 Democratic Convention the party ended up split between Al Smith and Franklin D. Roosevelt, a deadlock ensued, a few prominent Democrats including southerner William H. Murray drafted Huey Long as a dark horse candidate, many expecting to turn him into a puppet decided to unite and vote for the populist governor, the deadlock broke and Long obtained the nomination. Long ended up beating Herbert Hoover with a 56% of the popular vote. Ever since his election Long has been dealing with a deadlocked congress split between theDemocrats, Republicans and Bull Moose Progressives. Long despite being a Democrat has almost exclusively only received support from the Progressives as the Democratic Party now finds Long too left wing and populist despite his popular support. The future is uncertain for the United States and Huey Long, the 1936 election will decide the date of Long and the nation."

The Convention will convene in the Municipal Auditorium of New Orleans starting on June 4th.

The convention is being held in the Municipal Auditorium of New Orleans, a location that is very much in favor of Huey Long's renomination; however, local popular support makes no difference to a committeeman. More than a dozen challengers for the nomination have come forward with 4 major ones.\n\nPresident Huey Long at first glance obviously has an advantage due to him being the current President however his radical policies and lack of efficiency as President over the last 4 years has been very lackluster to many of the delegates. Long's Presidency has thus far been tormented by a congress controlled by Republicans and anti-Longest Democrats. Because of this Long has failed to get legislation passed to implement many of his campaign promises from 1932 where he only won the nomination due to the need of a dark horse candidate to break the deadlock between Al Smith and McAdoo.\n\nLong, however, was able to get the US off of the gold standard and has started some public works programs however still remains lackluster when you look at his larger promises from before. Despite it looking like Pro-Long politicians will soon hold a majority in Congress, the fact that most of them are members of the Progressive "Bull Moose" party has turned most of the DNC against Long."

Smith is a moderate Democrat who previously served as governor of New York and was formerly the President of Empire State I.N.C, the company that built the Empire state building in New York City.\n\nSmith supports an agenda of efficiency, limited but effective government intervention, reform, a moderate racial policy, passing of an anti-lynching law and staunchly in favour of the repealment of the 19th amendment. Smith is popular among moderate northern Democrats but has trouble with the parties Wilsonians and southerners due to Smith's Roman Catholic faith and his Italian-Irish heritage.\n\nWhile not having a solid foriegn policy due to other problems taking priority, Smith is known for wanting to create a larger military industry and be prepared for if the US ever needs to defend itself from radical governments like the Prussians and Argentinians.

He rose to prominence after assuming the leadership of the "Uptown Hudson Tubes" project which led to McAdoo successfully building a tunnel connecting Manhattan to New Jersey. He is currently serving as a senator from California. He wants a more centralized government banking system while still emphasizing non government involvement, while vocally supporting segregation of the US government and society. He is also a strict supporter of prohibition and dry laws. \n\nDespite this McAdoo also supported Women's suffrage.

Despite this, Garner isn't actually pursuing the nomination, if he wins it he will serve the American people but doesn't really want to be President.\n\nGarner, a Southern Democrat, is the current speaker of the house. Garner supports an agenda of mixed economics, he supported poll taxes in the south meaning he will probably bring a pro segregation policy to the table. He is a strict opponent of prohibition, famously drinking in the US capitol building despite knowing the legality of such an action.\n\nGarner is liked by many due to his middle of the road ideals however he leaves a lot to be desired due to never truly publicly solidifying ideals. Garner through his time as speaker of the house has become known as a great supporting role to get stuff done in the government but rarely comes up with ideas himself.Garner has no publicly known foriegn policy ideals.

Roosevelt is from New York and was raised by both the Delano and Roosevelt family. Living a life of luxury from a young age. Franklin is the cousin of former President Theodore Roosevelt who is a hated figure among Democrats but widely popular among the common people of the nation. FDR however aligned with us, the Democrats. Knowing that having a Roosevelt in the fold would bring us votes we brought him into the fold and he had a promising career. FDR unfortunately came down with polio in the late 1920s. Thankfully this was able to be shoved under the rug after he nursed himself back to an image of health during the following years.\n\nFranklin became governor of New York in 1929 and tried to use this platform to boost him to the Presidency in 1932, however his nomination by our party was blocked by a number of other groups in our party who disapproved of him and his idea of creating "the new deal". William Randolph Hearst, William H. Murray, Al Smith and a number of other politicians contested the convention results which led to the dark horse candidate that became President Huey Long. The blocking of Roosevelt's nomination deeply affected the man but with his never failing overwhelming optimism he took it as a message from god or whatever higher power is out there to finish his term as New York Governor, then step down, take time off, spend more time at his private recovery center in Warm Springs, Georgia and work on his health and ideas until the next chance to run for President arises. Also he should probably make his marriage with Elanor more than just a political alliance and bring back true love to their marriage. That was four years ago. FDR is almost in the condition of an average American his age. Polio still very much plagues his life but his incredible strength to overcome it as an obstacle has actually turned it into a propaganda tool. If he can beat polio he can beat anything!\n\nFDR will be listening to the Convention via radio tomorrow from his home in Hyde Park with his wife and family as the voting on candidates begins.Tonight a radio address by FDR will be nationally broadcasted to outline FDR's campaign platform."

Roosevelt drew parallels between the experiences of the American nation in recent years and those of his own. Comparing his slow regaining of strength after his diagnosis of polio to the slow progress the American economy is making to get back to normal.\n\nOn the topic of his partial paralysis caused by polio he had this to say: "Now I understand that you and I might have had some problems in the convention of 32, and that I should have told you earlier about the polio, but we all make mistakes. I have risen from that dark place and feel as good as new. If I can rise from the dust and move forward, than I am certain that with your help, your votes, and your cooperation, we; not me, but we, can make the american dream also rise from that dark place, and create a better America for all of us that will last for generations to come. I still hold by my statement from 1932, I promise you, the American people, a new deal!"\n\nThe radio address lasted close to an hour and is estimated to have been listened to by close to half of the nation."

Long receiving the least amount of votes from the delegates. The Convention reconvened today and a shock occurred. President Long stormed the Auditorium in New Orleans where the convention is being held with a posse of armed bodyguards, loyal Louisiana police men and loyal political allies. The armed goons locked the doors and refused to let anyone leave the convention. What followed next was very noticeable confusion from the delegates as President Long took to the podium and delivered a close to three hour speech with no script.\n\nLong denounced the Democratic convention as a fraud, accused multiple of the voters as sellouts to big business, compared Al Smith to Herbert Hoover and declared that the party had abandoned the American people for once and for all. The speech was still not even close to being over but most of the rest was inaudible yelling with a southern accent. Long and his posse then stormed out of the building declaring "When I'm done with it, this party will be dead and gone for good".\n\nLong has issued no further public statements but has changed his voter registration to identify as a prorgessive rather than a Democrat. Many have begun comparing the move to Theodore Roosevelt storming out of the 1912 Republican convention to form the Progressive Bull Moose party that went on to win the election. Time will tell if Long can actually win that party's nomination let alone the Presidential election. Most of the pro Long delegates for the DNC have either also walked out or pledged their votes to Franklin D. Roosevelt but this still doesn't give him the two thirds majority needed."

However the two candidates are at odds with Smith.\n\nSmith is a Northern Democrat who has supported the rights of immigrants and Catholics while John Nance Garner supported the passing and implementation of poll tax legislation in Texas that saw not just Blacks, but many immigrants and Catholics lose their ability to vote. Meanwhile McAdoo disagrees with Smith on their racial views as Smith is more of a moderate while McAdoo is a segregationist. Smith's economic policies also fall in line with Roosevelt's much more than Smith's.\n\nHowever, privately Smith has promised to bring McAdoo on the ticket as his Vice-President if McAdoo gets the California and Western delegates to pledge their votes to Smith.

This year has had yet another sweltering hot summer in New York setting new state records. As Franklin finally closes his eyes to drift off to a much needed nap, the telephone on his desk begins its obnoxiously loud ringing. After letting the phone ring once, twice, maybe three times, Franklin finally leans forward, reaches out and picks up the phone and answers in a loud and cheerful tone "Franklin speaking" trying to make sure the tiredness in his voice isn't noticeable.\n\n"Mr. Roosevelt it's Marguerite, a Mr. William Gibbs McAdoo is here to see you" she paused, FDR recognized the voice of Marguerite or "Missy" his private secretary and everyday assistant, she resumed "Shall I let him in?" Roosevelt leaned back and thought for a second, if the convention hasn't ended what the hell is McAdoo doing in New York? And why is he here to see me? We're opponents.\n\nRoosevelt readjusted himself in his chair, sitting up as straight as possible to make sure he looked as awake as possible before lighting a cigarette while saying "Send him in", the phone clicked as it was put back and Franklin took a long drag of his cigarette, saying quietly under his breath "This ought to be interesting" just as Senator McAdoo entered the room"

Maybe back in 32 at the convention".\n\nThe two men sat down and exchanged the normal small talk as a means of making McAdoo's visit seem as if it  wasn't strictly for political reasons.

However Warren has alienated the conservative wing of the Republicans under Robert Taft and John W. Bricker, who despite not being a risk of bolting to the democrats or progressives, could influence their supporters to stay home on election day. Warren has raised some public debates due to his heavy involvement in the FreeMasons in California. Warren is also an outspoken member of "The Native Sons of the Golden West" a west coast nativist organization with a heavy focus on anti-Japanese rhetoric.\n\nOn top of this, he rejects the mainstream Republican views of pro-isolationist foriegn policy, alienating even more Republicans. Despite all this, Warren holds a real chance with plenty of support from wealthy FreeMasons, liberal politicians and could possibly draw some voters from the Progressives. Warren addressed a large crowd in Los Angeles with a half hour speech that got the crowd so rallied up that newspapers are calling him the Republican William Jennings Bryan, and supporters are beginning to call him "the Great Pacifican"."

USA_starting_events.1.t:0 "Operation Emancipation"
USA_starting_events.1.d:0 "Today the United States launched an invasion of the west African nation of Liberia.\n\nThe invasion was launched after Liberian President Charles D.B King rejected US demands to investigate if the nation's government was using slave labor practiced by big companies like the Firestone rubber company. Hence the name "Operation Emancipation"\n\nThe operation is being commanded by General Douglas Macarthur with three US brigadier generals working under him, those being Harry S. Truman, George S. Patton and Theodore Roosevelt Jr."
USA_starting_events.1.a:0 "The American Empire Grows Once More"

USA_starting_events.2.t:0 "Our Coast of Darkness"
USA_starting_events.2.d:0 " A long time ago in 1821 the American Colonization society was founded and began colonizing a small part of the African coast just south of Sierra Leone. This small colony they founded was to become the nation of Liberia. The colonizers however we're not whites, but blacks. Liberia became a nation/colony where free blacks from the United States could return to Africa and escape the cruel persecution blacks experienced in the United States. However over the years the nation began implement systems and policies that made Liberia virtually identical to the antebellum south where the African Americans established a rich and influential planter class that stripped the native Africans of rights and implemented policies that we're slavery in all but name. The Liberian government later purchased Sierra Leone from the British Empire. Liberia gradually drifted away from our sphere throughout the 1800s.\n\nHowever in 1909 Liberia faced a debt crisis due to unpaid loans to Europeans that made it vulnerable to European intervention and occupation by the British and Austrians. President William Howard Taft granted Liberia a loan that saw the issue of the debt crisis delayed all the while increasing our nation's influence over Liberia. In late 1912 however Liberia faced yet another debt crisis after the funds from our bailout dried up after inefficient spending and pocketing of the money by government officials. President Theodore Roosevelt decided to intervene in the crisis in a similar manner as the US had done in multiple American nations during their various debt crises. One politician made headlines after saying "The Monroe doctrine doesn't apply to Monrovia and neither does your corollary". Regardless, the US placed a military governor in charge of Liberia to oversee the government's debt payments.\n\nIn 1920 the military governor was recalled and Liberia had new elections. Charles D.B King won the 1920 election and gave hope but is surrounded in scandal after he has stayed in the office of Liberian presidency for 16 years through obviously fraudulent elections. There is also rumors that the Liberian government is ignoring labour practices similar to slavery. Time will only tell what our little slice of Africa's future will look like. But for now, they are loosely in our sphere."

USA_starting_events.3.d:0 "We have had multiple recent anonymous reports from our friends over in Liberia that the nation's government put in place after the end of the military occupation in 1920 has failed to uphold human rights and has been turning a blind eye and even actively participating in and benefitting from forced labor. We have also had tons of reports of the Firestone rubber company bribing multiple government officials that rank as high up as the Vice-President in exchange for the government turning a blind eye to inhumane working conditions.\n\nNow this has put our government in a bit of an awkward position as on the world stage, Liberia is effectively recognized as being in our sphere of influence and functions as a de facto puppet state or even colony. Forced labor and slavery is not looked favourly upon by our fellow world powers and the worlds eyes turn to our government to get involved in Liebria's scandal.\n\nPresident Long on the urging of his cabinet has demanded the Liberian government allow inspectors from the US to investigate these claims and work to get the nation free of these conditions and expose and rid the government of the corruption. The world turns their eyes to Liberian President Charles D.B King's response to the demands."

Outside the White House D.C feels frozen over with a light snow coming down over the city and yet the kingfish is wide awake in a conference room in the White house with multiple US generals and political staff members. The Liberian government sent it's response to our demands for them to allow a group of US inspectors to investigate the rumors of possible slavery in the nation and the involvment of the Firestone rubber company in government bribery. The Liberian government sent a letter signed by President Charles D.B King stating the demands  "An unnecessary witch hunt propped up by opponents of Liberia's True Whig party".\n\nAs President Long sat in a chair on one side of the table still wearing light blue pajamas and a black pair of socks, smoking a cigar, he listened to the diplomat reading the letter out loud before promptly getting up and turning to general Douglas McArthur and saying "Send the army and navy to deal with these bastards. Send at least three Generals, make sure their celebrity types as well, we might be able to get some good press for this. I got a feeling we'll be sticking around in Africa for a while".\n\nLong promptly left the room before walking through the white house to grab a late night snack from the kitchen with a friend who quoted the Kingfish with saying "If only Jeff Davis could see us now. A southern president intervening in a nation to prevent slavery. What has the world come to!""

Surrounding the table with him was Brigadier General Theodore Roosevelt Jr. on his left, with Brigadier General George S. Patton and Brigadier General Harry S. Truman on his right.\n\nThe plan was laid out as follows. The Liberians are not expecting the arrival of our troops so minimal resistance should be encountered on the coast when the forces under each commander make their landings. If resistance by the Liberian frontier force is encountered then the landings will be supported by a naval and air bombardment. The predominantly infantry forces under Theodore Jr. and Harry Truman will advance through the coastal regions of Liberia as quickly as possible while Patton's forces with tank Support will be focused around occupying the cities and towns of the nation to prevent resistance; given the circumstance of the intervention it is unlikely that our forces will encounter popular resistance but only time will tell.\n\nThe operation has been rightfully named "Operation Emancipation" and shall commence soon."

Around 5 am in Liberia our fleet began a bombardment of a Liberian garrison stationed on the coast and our first waves of troops landed directly on the shores of the Liberian capital city of Monrovia.\n\nThe first troops we're under the command of Brigadier General Theodore Roosevelt Jr. son of former President and political legend Theodore Roosevelt. Theodore Jr. who personally landed on the beaches with his men noted a large lack of organized resistance and a group of Liberians who actually came up and greeted the US forces as friends.\n\nBrigadier Generals Harry Truman, and George Patton have also noted the lack of resistance as most of the Liberian frontier force has even surrendered to approaching US forces.\n\nOur operation has been a success thus far and is projected to continue on this path, a much needed victory to kickstart our nations morale after years of economic and political crises."

The success of our operation and the moral reasoning for the operation in the first palace has helped President Huey Long with a boost of support predominantly in the northern United States."

Prohibition prevents our people from drinking and prevents us from taking advantage of the tax revenue distilleries could produce. And to top it all off, after the non stop change of the Theodore Roosevelt administrations saw our nation's racial policies go toward equality, only to see them back pedalled multiple times since more conservative Presidents have taken office.\n\nHuey Long was elected in 1932 after Oklahoma politician William H. Murry proposed him as a dark horse candidate to break the deadlock between Franklin Roosevelt and Al Smith at the Democratic convention. Despite him winning soundly over Herbert Hoover, Long has remained unpopular among most Democrats and has not fulfilled most of his campaign promises except building up revenue reserves. The election of 1936 is coming up and if Long wants to win he'll have to partake in some bitter fighting to secure his nomination."

Only a couple days after his big speech, the first of his reelection campaign, Democratic Party leaders who had once clashed with Long over his rivalry with consertatives and the late Franklin Delano Roosevelt were now throwing their full support behind Long. The Democratic Party had been split into 3 factions during the decisive 1932 elections: the Smith Faction, the Roosvelelt Faction, and the Longist faction. Due to the lasting impacts of the Great Depression and FDR's scandals, Huey had won the initially close primary in a blowout. He had recieved scorn from the likes of Harry Byrd and John Nance Garner. But today, he picked up today's New York Times, the major headline being, "Garner endorses the Kingfish!"\n\nLong put down the phone and got up to go get dressed. He would continue to campaign today in the primaries against Al Smith, but he knew his winning the primary would be far easier with the support of the Roosevelts. Now, it was time to move forward."

But after Wallace tried to pass the bill in Congress it was clear that even if congress Would fully support all stages of the bill, the treasury does not have the spare funds to allow all 3 stages of the bill to pass.

On race, Warren does not believe in enforcing segregation against Latins and Negros while holding a strong anti Japanese rhetoric, similar to many of the Bull Moose old guard, such as Hiram Johnson. Warren kept his address brief and placed a heavy emphasis on the far reaching but agreeable reform that he plans to bring to the nation.

A large amount of the party has supported low tariffs since the civil war while another has advocated for raising them greatly. Specifically the Wilsonians have recently been the largest advocate for low import tariffs while leftover progressives and liberals from Long's Presidency advocate for raising the tariffs. Smith has proposed a compromise that will reconcile slightly with both groups while still serving great purpose for our economy and our foreign affairs."
USA_smith_tree.3.t:0 "Tariff Diplomacy"
USA_smith_tree.3.d:0 "President Smith has begun the implementation of a policy he likes to call "tariff diplomacy". Smith notes that the federal government needs new streams of revenue if it is to continue giving relief to the people affected by our nation's woes. Instead of raising taxes however President Smith is turning his eyes to a new path. "Tariff Diplomacy" works like this. Tariffs will be placed on all imported goods in the United States to a certain rate. This is to encourage people to buy American products and produce American products. Now the second part ties this policy into diplomacy. Tariffs will be raised exponentially on nations with governments the United States deems as radical, oppressive or unjust, including illegitimate nations as well as other nations the US has already had poor relationships with. Tariffs on nations deemed friendly however will be lowered to increase trade relations while still limiting our dependence on foriegn goods. For example, the nations of Prussia under Herman von Goering, Italy under Mussolini and the fascists, as well as the radical governments of Argentina and Chile. SUprising many people however is that tariffs on the United Kingdom and the British dominions remain extremely low, leading most people to believe that Smith will pursue a policy of rapprochement with the British after our diplomatic falling out during the Europakrieg."

To combat this President Smith has proposed a public housing plan that has strict rules. The main ones being as follows. 1: Apartments in said projects are to be kept in good condition. Free maintenance support will be offered but it is expected that residents will take care of their apartments. 2. No drugs or illegal parifinelia is to be inside the projects at any time. 3. Guests visiting residents can stay no more than one week. 4. Residents are to actively pursue school, jobs in the private sector, or in a public work program. 5. If determined that a resident has ample saved money to move out and support themselves on their own they will be given one month to move out. Failure to comply with these rules and several others will result in immediate eviction. This will supply homes to the people and encourage them if not force them to seek out employment."

A few weeks ago in a brief conversation Smith met with Hoover and asked him to look into the nation's strikes that have been going non stop since knowledge of the McAdoo Plot became public. He has also asked Hoover to look into the private affairs of many Wilsonian politicians and ensure no one else was knowingly involved in "The McAdoo Plot".

Specifically "Big" Bill Haywood and Earl Browder have rallied industrial unions in the midwest, coal miners in West Virginia and miners in Colorado to go on strikes. And while not being the size of a general strike, these strikes have turned into a noticeable thorn in our side. Thankfully Hoover has already sent agents to infiltrate these strikers and cause division from the inside. Unfortunately this will not be without sacrifice, a group of oblivious police officers in Detroit Michigan will be sent to arrest some of the strikers, during the arrest they will be shot by our agent to make the strikers look like terrorists. This same plan will be replicated throughout the country. Some will die but sometimes a small amount of blood needs to be split to prevent anarchy."

Hoover has told the President that he and his best agents cannot find any solid evidence linking any of the Wilsonians directly to the "McAdoo Plot" but does personally believe that many of them we're still involved in it. However, many of the Wilsonians of lesser influence can be linked to the Klu Klux Klan and even some criminal organizations, while the higher standing members of the Wilsonians are clearly better at covering their tracks. Despite us not being able to take down the top dogs, making public knowledge of the lesser standing Wilsonians involvement with these controversial organizations will help destroy the Wilsonians national influence and reputation. This won't eradicate the Wilsonians like the President hoped but it will cause a large permanent amount of damage that will prevent the Wilsonians from posing any major threat to Smith's Presidency or any of the other parties for that matter for the foreseeable future, a future where Hoover and his FBI will be keeping close tabs on them."

USA_smith_tree.4.d:0 "Prohibition or the 19th amendment was a constitutional amendment passed by President Theodore Roosevelt and his progressives prohibiting the sale, distribution and transportation of alcohol. The law was widely supported by close to 60% of the population at the least. However the popular support that had been building ever since the early temperance movements of the late 1700s would not last after the passing of the 19th amendment. People quickly became parched and thirsty for a drink. However the lack of legal vendors for alcohol meant people would have to look elsewhere for their alcohol and resort to illegal means. People began driving to Canada, buying liquor and driving back with Whiskey without raising suspicion, Canadian smugglers began floating small barges and barrels of alcohol across lake St.Clair into Detroit, Michigan where Criminal networks would then distribute the liquor nationwide. While most rural and protestant communities often abide by the 19th amendment of the constitution, many cities like New Orleans Louisiana for example seem as if Prohibition was never taken into effect, even then Governor Huey Long said "Not a damn thing!" when asked what Louisiana was doing to enforce prohibition.\n\nThe problem with prohibition is that it is an unenforceable law on a national level and the lack of liquor in many places has led to the rise of organized crime organizations, most predominantly the Sicilian American mafia. These organizations have led to an uptick in crimes related to prohibition, prostitution, extortion and murder. Step one to getting rid of these organizations could be ending prohibition. President Smith has long been a supporter of the removal of prohibition but many Republicans and rural communities still support the law. The question is now, will Smith pursue a path of limiting prohibition to counties that will decide on the issue for themselves or will he pursue a path of rallying support for complete federal removal of prohibition."

The new 21st amendment allows a popular vote in every separate township or city to decide whether or not said township will legalize the production, and sale, of alcohol. Obviously this will be a flawed system, if your township is voted "dry" and the next town over is voted "wet" you can just simply go to the next town and buy your alcohol and have no repercussions due to the transportation of said alcohol being federally protected now nationwide.

Through careful reforms in New York City and throughout the rest of the state by Smith and his political allies he turned Tammany hall from a organization of lying and corruption to a organization of progressive democratic reformers that work for the common man and not big business or political bosses.

The Wilsonians are responsible yet blame the whole fiasco on Smith. Their radical ideas, hypocrisy and disloyalty to the party, the President and the American people is unforgivable and action shall be taken against them as Smith and the Tammany Hall Machine now openly and actively campaign for Liberal Democrats and even Republicans and Progressives over Wilsonians and begin to limit and remove them from the Democratic Party."

Hearst is now wrapped up in over 10 lawsuits and multiple more class action lawsuits filed against many of his publishing companies. Hearst is being prosecuted under the alien and seditions act, being sued for defamation, obstruction of justice among other things. Former President Theodore Roosevelt has also weighed in on the radio publicly announcing support for the prosecution of Hearst. While it is likely that Hearst's  grade A legal will be able to defeat these suits, it is predicted it will take 10 at least  years for all of the suits to end. While Hearst may win the various lawsuits, the money and reputation he will lose from it will be irreplaceable and thus making him no longer a threat to President Smith."

We will gladly do our part; however, if the British Empire expects payment and tribute in exchange for good relations then they have another thing coming. We will offer them nothing and see the results.\n\n2. Jamaica:\nThe Island of Jamaica saw a black uprising during our standoff with Britian during the Europakrieg that we chose to support to weaken Britian's sphere in the Americas, However the island nation has become dependent on us both economically and militarily, costing us valuable money that we could be spending on ourselves, on top of this many politicians in our nation disapprove of the majority black government there. We could get rid of our burden in Jamaica once and for all and offer the island back to the British in hopes that they will view our current negotiations in a more favorable way, but it's unlikely we'll actually make any sort of profit from this move.\n\n3. Business Concessions:\nWe need the British to come through in our current negotiations, we understand that they need some incentive, but handing over land and surrendering people's freedom in exchange for their diplomatic support is unacceptable. The United States has one major advantage over almost every other nation in the world, even during trying economic times. Money.

Allen sat hunched over his desk in the treasury building, yet another sleepless night, waiting for the final budget and spending report for the year to come in. Spending the last 5 years as the secretary of treasury hadn't been the easiest job, especially for a man who's previous experience in government had only been as governor of Louisiana, and even then, Oscar was often found asking himself "What kind of Governor was I?". As Oscar got up from his desk to look out the window at the night sky the question reappeared again. Oscar's reputation in his home state had been tarnished. He was known as nothing more than a stooge for Huey, a puppet who had Long's hand stuck so far up his ass that he could tickle Oscar's brain; the reputation drew boos from crowds and quiet snickers behind his back from the people whom he had previously considered "friends". But either too blind to see it or too arrogant to realize his place as a pawn to care, Oscar had never realized how much his reputation had been tarnished until he came to Washington.\n\nA knock on the door interrupted his train of thought "Come in" he stated loudly, still looking at the night sky out the window. He heard the clacking of heels on the floor as the door was shut behind whoever entered the room, presumably his secretary Lidnsey. "You can put the budget report on my desk Lindsey, and then head home for the night, you've earned it". Still looking out the window Oscar was startled to hear the voice of a woman whom he had come to know on a much closer basis "Oscar its me", instantly recognizing her voice, Oscar knew it wasn't his secretary Lindsey but instead, his "companion" Barbara, a struggling club singer whom he met after his wife had fell ill. It didn't sound like the kindest thing, to leave his wife at home with nurses as she suffers from her sicknesses, and run around town with a mistress instead, but with what Oscar had to deal with on a daily basis, he'd probably die of a heart attack if he had no source of "relief". He turned quickly to face her and with anger in his voice yelled at her "what the hell are you doing here! Were you followed?" his face red, his veins bulging out of his neck, as Barbara began to break down sobbing he promptly smacked her "What the hell do you think you're doing here!" Barabra promptly collapsed to the floor, taking out an envelope with "From Huey" written on the back before crying out "He knows Oscar" now sobbing "I don't know how but he has photos!""

USA_mcadoo_tree.2.d:0 "Today William Gibbs McAdoo took the oath of office at 7:30 am after President Al Smith was murdered during a speech in Cincinnati, Ohio. It's well known that President Smith and McAdoo we're often at odds especially after Smith put McAdoo in charge of the administration's social agenda and policies which led to McAdoo almost single handedly creating a new American nativist movement. McAdoo is the son in law of Woodrow Wilson, a controversial figure in the Democratic party. Wilson's followers are now known as "Wilsonians" and McAdoo is, in most ways, their leader. McAdoo however is a controversial character as he can be a prorgessive and a conservative. A fan of libral economic intervention but a strict supporter of the gold standard. A supporter of women's rights but not that of the negro. The US seems to be going a step forward in some departments but a step back in others."

However the problem is larger than himself now. Small race riots have been constant all throughout the nations ever since McAdoo's speech in Richmond. Members of the Wilsonian branch of the Democratic party, representatives of some black organizations and some Moderate Democrats have all come together to agree upon the future of blacks in our nation. Two main solutions have been proposed.\n\nThe first solution being a continued path of "Social control" where the government will work to give equal employment opportunities to blacks to help improve quality of life for Blacks while still maintaining strict policies in terms of segregation and suppression of Black musicians, politicians and civil rights leaders.\n\nThe other proposal was actually brought up by some of the black representatives, one of which said "It is clear the people of these United States are not in favour of an administration that would grant my people equal rights, representation and opportunities to the pursuit of happiness. We are treated like a burden yet held back against our will. If we are not to be accepted as equals in this nation then let us be truly free and  of no burden to you in our own nation" The proposal revives the old idea of encouraging American blacks to immigrate to Liberia. In exchange blacks will be given economic aid and land in Liberia.\n\nSome hardline Wilsonians have come out in support of this idea as it would remove what they view as lesser being from the United States while others denounced it as it would create a foriegn enemy. Regardless, the majority of Blacks and liberals are not represented at this meeting and the decision is ultimately in President McAdoo's hand."

Obviously this would be the final death blow to American companies and our economy. While we have worked hard to prevent any leaks about the plan from getting out, it seems some members of our administration have some friends in high places.

USA_democratic_schism_events.1.d:0 "The Democratic Party has been struggling to find a true identity since the civil war. Every presidential election after the civil war besides 1932 has been a disaster for US Democrats; even the victory in 1932 has been disgraced as the victor, Huey Long, has since left our party. Our party has been especially divided since the times of our former presidential nominee Woodrow Wilson. Wilson guided a significant chunk of our party back to our parties very conservative roots, especially when it comes to racial theory and the legacy of the Confederacy. Truly deciding our identity could take the next few decades but these next 4 years will ultimately prove the most signifcant in the long run.\n\nWith Al Smith winning the election, we have a solid base to now build the future upon. Smith in hopes of uniting both the moderate conservatives and Wilsonians as they call themselves has called for a large conference with every major Democrat in the nation to take place at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in New York City a week from today. The location of the conference itself has drawn some controversy from the Wilsonians as many of them view holding the conference in an urban environment in the north completely disregards the parties history. The success of this conference will be seen soon enough."

One of which said "Smith is the opposite of what our party represents" another saying "I never realized how far ahead a redneck could get ahead in this world until I met the men in there" referencing the more conservative wilsonians of the party. It is also said that drunken brawls have occurred inside the conference as multiple representatives from the party have reportedly snuck in alcohol despite some being supporters of prohibition. This madness has drawn both the progressives under former president Huey Long and the Republicans to refer to the conference as the "brawl of the asses" a reference to the party's staple donkey logo.\n\nHowever despite all this, Vice-President William Gibbs Mcadoo, a wilsonian who was chosen for vice president as a compromise for the party earlier this year has reportedly begun lobbying support for a compromise that would see him handle the presidents social policies while the president instead focuses on the depression. Only time will see if this compromise is accepted by the party."

However William Gibbs Mcadoo has proposed a gentlemen's agreement in front of the conference that he be put in complete charge of the nation's social affairs in hopes of "preserving the constitution and preserving states rights". This has drawn protests from moderate democrats and civil rights leaders, one is quoted as saying "that man Mcadoo would see us black men put back in chains and our nation renamed the confederacy the first chance he gets". Mcadoo has not commented on these comments and Al Smith has not left the Hotel as he is contemplating accepting Mcadoo's proposition fearing it may be the only way to keep the party together."

The deal would see Mcadoo effectively take control of the social policies of the federal government during Smith's presidency, it would also invest extra powers in Mcadoo to prevent "government tyranny" as Wilsonian Democrats say. Accepting this would see the party hold onto the Wilsonians but could see a revival in systemic racism implemented by the government. Declining could see the party lose the support of the Wilsonians but this can't be guaranteed. It is President Smith's decision to make."

A small number of the Wilsonians that left the conference early are supposedly leaving the party and attempting to form a new party however it is unlikely to gain any real momentum and most of the walk out politicians are expected to come crawling back to the Democratic party. While many speculate that if President Smith accepted the proposal it would've just delayed this inevitable split after years of growing rifts in the party but that is neither here nor there. In rejecting Vice-President Mcadoo's proposal we have a guarantee of a slightly more moderate racial policy dictated by Smith, not exactly a beacon of racial equality but at least not a segregationist."

Three of those appearances being on the radio in opposition to Al Smith's decision to give McAdoo control over the administrations racial policies, saying "If you just woulda declined their compromise those bastards woulda had no place else to go". Long has come back into the public eye in light of the current mess in Richmond saying "McAdoo is one of them imperial bastards in disguise, this filth has be ridden of" in reference of McAdoo's strange friendly relationship with the Klu Klux Klan despite not being an official known member. Long has asked; like Coughlin, for as many of his supporters and members of the Bull Moose Progressive party to go and protest the Vice-President's speech tomorrow. Long also addressed the issue of his former ties with Gerald L.K Smith in relation to Long's "Share our Wealth society" and Smith's stint as Long's national organizer, Long saying "Smith has lost his goddam marbles, he's a no good bastard these days, his family oughta be ashamed! And dam McAdoo for bringing someone as crazy as Smith on a stage!". Long will be going with his followers to protest the speech reportedly already boarding a plane to fly to Richmond."

The first of the groups expected to appear for Vice-Presidents McAdoo's Speech tomorrow have begun to arrive, starting off with the Klu Klux Klan. A small portion of the group around 1,000 strong has begun marching through the streets with torches in hand. Reports are already coming out that men associated with the group have set up multiple burning crosses around the city in predominantly black areas. At 12:50 the city was again hit by storm as a mix of Long, Coughlin and Bull Moose party supporters all marched into the city, almost immediately violent clashes between the groups and the KKK erupted that have led to 2 cases of shots fired, one reported stabbing and a molotov cocktail being thrown that led to a apartment building burning down that was thankfully vacant. As more and more people arrive these tensions are likely to only get worse. As Huey Long has arrived in the city there is sure to be a counter rally in protest against McAdoo. Coughlin has also rented a home in the outskirts of Richmond with the intention of protesting the Speech tomorrow. W.E.B Du Bois and multiple other African American civil rights activists from various organizations including the NAACP will be there as well in hopes of protesting and ending the speech before it begins.Whatever happens, it'll be messy.

Not only Charles Coughlin but also famous black civil rights activist W.E.B Du Bois was found hanging from a tree in the Carver neighborhood of Richmond where he was staying, also with the intention of protesting McAdoo's speech. Even more shocking is Former President Huey P. Long's hotel room in the Jefferson Hotel has been found riddled with bullet holes, and practically coated with blood but the whereabouts of the Kingfish are unknown. It is unknown how anyone got past Long's security. But a small piece of cloth with a red cross on it left on the floor ties the attack to the lynching of Charles Coughlin and Du Bois. both of whom we're found next to burning crosses. It is clear who is behind the attacks. There are other reports of multiple local politicians and prominent citizens also being hung and murdered but the estimate is unknown but above 5. President Smith, similar to the last few days hasn't commented on the situation and has apparently locked himself in the oval office with only his most trusted secret service members. McAdoo is apparently asleep according to a staff member."

To most this is seen as a cheap attempt at historical revision to make the Confederates be looked upon in a better light than they are, but in white southern communities the movement has taken off, mostly thanks to the support of the already predominant "Daughters of the confederacy" organization that succeeded in putting up multiple statues commemorating confederate war heroes.

We must reform it, not only to help encourage people to return to private sector employment but to also help the Federal government save money. The only question is how? We have two possible solutions currently on the table. 1. Cut funding for welfare programs and tighten requirements or 2. Slightly expand the budgets and orientate the programs towards job programs designating it towards providing jobs and training for Americans for future work experience in the private sector. The 1st option saves us money which can then be used elsewhere but doesn't help those in need that much, the 2nd option will slightly hurt oucr ash reserves but will help employ countless Americans."

However the next year the stock market crashed on Black Friday November 27th 1924. 12 years later and the US economy is still stagnant. Most Americans are out of a job, struggling to make ends meet and close to starvation. Long was elected on his policy of economic aid, rural investment and public works programs. Here in 1936 Long is finally making progress in his breakthrough to implement his policies 4 years after his election. With new candidates racing in support of different policies such as William Borah's Coolidge-esque de-regulation policies and Al Smith's anti New Deal approach this election will decide how the economy of America could be changed forever.

Or so it was, Warren was interrupted hearing the phone on his desk ring, he quickly leaned forward and answered, "President speaking."\n\n"Mr. President, Mr. Thomas Dewey is here to see you about some cabinet appointments, I think?"\n\nWarren quietly sighed and whispered under his breath "what does he want now?"\n\nHis secretary responded "Sorry, I didn't hear you, Mr. President"\n\nWarren piped up "Just send him in".\n\nA few seconds later Dewey entered the oval office "Mr. President, you cannot seriously be thinking about letting Taft's yes man get the secretary of the interior appointment?"\n\nWarren rolled his eyes, he thought Dewey would be a competent and great national leader, but in private, he sure could be a pain in his ass.\n\n"Thomas, I understand the frustration. And I have just as many reservations about Taft as you do, but I need to throw a bone to the conservatives every now and then too. Besides, I haven't seen any nominations from your side of the aisle." The President exclaimed matter of factly.\n\nDewey quickly responded, "Their kid Nixon is 23 years old Warren, he's got no experience, I have got a far more experienced choice, and unlike Nixon, he isn't just a puppet from my side of the party."\n\nDewey threw down a file on Warren's desk and walked out. President Warren opened the file to see a dossier on Theodore Roosevelt's experience in conservationism, the former president sure would enrage the conservative wing of the Republicans but might help bring the Progressives back into the fold.

Warren was half dozing off by this point, it had been 15 minutes and Robert Taft was still going on about the importance of "Fiscal Responsibility", but he knew Taft had at least one point. If he were to let the Liberals get a leg up on the conservatives in the party or vice versa it could cause quite a stir and hurt his agenda. Taft wanted Herbert Hoover for Treasurer to ensure strict Fiscal Responsibility and Dewey wanted James J. Couzens, someone more in line with the Liberals and Warren's personal favorite. Warren spoke up and  was trying desperately to hide the frustration in his voice "Taft,, you want me to appoint a former President who people name shanty towns after for christs sake, if you want us to get anything done you're gonna need to give a better name then.." but Taft quickly interrupted "Mr. President, you and I both know this depression wasn't his fault" Warren chuckled under his breath before responding "Taft, to be quite frank, it doesn't matter what I think, it's what the people think that matter, Now as I said, you need to give me a better name or else this is gonna get…" Taft interrupted again "I trust you'll do the right thing Mr. President" before promptly hanging up, Warren sat back in astonishment, that kid sure has some guts to hang up on the President like that."

Warren sat behind his desk looking at the files in front of him. The one on the left had been delivered by Thomas Dewey with his nomination for secretary of state in it. A quizzical look appeared on Warren's face as he read through Dewey's nomination. Dewey suggested Republican John Foster Dulles receive the nomination, no surprise there. The strange part however was Dewey's request for Warren to nominate Cordell Hull for Assistant secretary of state, a Democrat. Both men advocate for a stronger American role in the world. Warren put the file down and grabbed the second file on his right, delivered by Robert Taft, containing his respective nomination. Taft suggested that Warren nominate John Bassett Moore, a lifelong Republican who held the position of Assistant secretary of state way back in the 1890s. Of course, an isolationist like Taft.

His Majesty will also recognize the United States Government as the sovereign owner of all british territories in the Bahamas, Caribbean and the Canadian west coast including the Islands of Vancouver island and Haida Gwaii. A Response will be required within 48 hours. Upon agreeing to these terms his majesty will authorize the immediate transfer of these territories to their new sovereign leaders or face major consequences" If we agree to these terms our Empire will no doubt be agreeing to both a humiliating snub and economic repercussions.

Immediately after the negotiations began the British government agreed to immediately begin the transition of the demanded territories to the U.S and France immediately. France now holds one of the most important waterways in the world and the U.S now controls more of the American continent.

After negotiations ended, it became clear the British would give in to our demands. Hoping to avoid war, the British Prime minister and his majesty have declared this move to secure "peace in our time". Our empire is now slightly larger, but will make untold fortunes off of taxing ships passing through the canal."

After the British sent delegates met with the D.C Pact's diplomates in Vancouver it became immediately clear the British would fold to their demands in hope of preventing a future war between the two factions.

It has slowly been gaining land in Central America and has been gaining more and more influence in the state. Yet the current Sandinista leader has been reluctant to let them play a bigger role, so it is our job to make sure the people know of the clear benefits of United Fruit investment. With Central American Elections coming up soon, we hope to get our candidate Francisco Javier Arana in power.\n\nCurrently, our influence in Centro-American politics is §Y[?CEN_USA_Influence]§! out of 1000.\n\n§CIf we secure a high enough influence, our candidate will be elected and we will control all Central American activities.§!"

A truly impressive accomplishment, the bridge was opened by Huey Long in one of his rare visits to the state who cut the read tape to allow traffic onto the bridge. It is already being turned into a tourist attraction, currently on nearly every single San Francisco postcard."
