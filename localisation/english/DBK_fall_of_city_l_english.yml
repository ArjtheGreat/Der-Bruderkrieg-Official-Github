DBK_fall_of_city.1.d:0 "Vienna, the Habsburg Capital has fallen to the armies of the nation of Prussia. The Prussians, after encircling the city with the help of the Panzer-Brigades, dug in for a brutal siege. The Austrian Armies tried to break the siege and relieve the city with a huge offensive, but soon enough, they were unsuccessful. The Kaiser and his family were quickly evacuated from the city, escorted by the Austrian rear-guards. The gleeful Prussian troops treated themselves to Viennese Beer and Wiener Schnitzels in a grand party thrown by the Generals. The Eagle on the Prussian flag is visible from afar on the St. Stephen’s Cathedral. This is a huge victory for the Prussians, and if they keep up the momentum, the entirety of Austria may fall under the German Thumb."
