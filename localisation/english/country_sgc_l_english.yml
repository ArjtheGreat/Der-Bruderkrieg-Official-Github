FRANZ_FERDINAND_DESC:0 "Archduke Franz Ferdinand was born on December 18, 1863, the son of Karl Ludwig, brother of the Emperor Franz Joseph. The Archduke led a happy childhood and didn’t expect to be anything but a prince until the Mayerling Incident in 1889. In the aftermath of Rudolf’s suicide, Franz was suddenly second in line for the throne, after his father. Franz, a restless spirit, traveled all over the world, famously killing an Indian elephant on his travels. He was called back for the death of his father in 1896, making him heir apparent. Franz had been an outspoken Slavophile and anti-Magyar before becoming heir, after which his opinions only intensified. A friend of the Croats and the Czechs, he seemed destined to renew the 1848 alliance between the Habsburgs and the Slavs within the Empire. But then, he stumbled upon Countess Sophie Chotek. They began a secret relationship, only to be revealed by Archduyke Isabella. The scandal might have ended there, had it not been for Franz Ferdinand’s love. The Emperor refused to allow a marriage, and Franz refused to marry anyone else. Finally, in 1899, the Emperor lost patience with Franz and disinherited him as heir, replacing him with Franz’s nephew, Karl. Franz was shocked at the decision but defiantly stood by his will, and he married Sophie that same year. The Archduke would not speak to the Emperor again for 14 years. After that, Franz found himself and his Slavic allies marginalized by pro-Magyar voices in the Empire. However, Franz was never angry at Karl himself for his disinheritance, and slowly began to influence Karl towards working with the Slavophiles, which would prove critical during the Europakrieg.\nFranz and Sophie enjoyed a very happy marriage, but on June 28, 1914, while they were parading through Munich, a Volkisch assassin fired on their car. While Franz was only wounded, Sophie was killed. An infuriated and grief-stricken Franz demanded war, a call echoed by the entire court. They would come to regret this when Germany, Italy, and Russia mobilized against them. With the court split between an alliance of the Austrian and Hungarian aristocracy and the Slavophile faction, Franz was unable to gain any traction while the old Emperor remained in power, but after the defeats of Conrad von Hotzendorf and the death of Franz Joseph, Karl quickly reformed the army in Franz's favor. Franz was quite pleased with this. After the Europakrieg, while Karl’s Slavic allies remained loyal, some of Franz’s anti-Magyar policies would come back to bite the Empire in the Third Hungarian Revolution. While this was not entirely Franz’s fault, his enemies among the aristocracy scapegoated him, and sent him to Munich, a city he had come to loathe, to ensure the alliance remained intact. Franz’s high handed running of the Confederation did strengthen Austrian power initially, but eventually angered the entire population, severely weakening the Confederation. After the crises of 1936, Karl decided to leave Franz in place, and he has attained total subjugation of the area to Austria. The aging eagle, disinherited and alone, flies over South Germany, pledging to never surrender to unificationists."

The Bavarian ministry is in a war of influence with the arrogant Austrian ambassador, Franz Ferdinand. Increasingly tyrannical and powerful, Franz Ferdinand has demanded the dissolution of the mostly Bavarian ministry, and in turn, it has demanded his recall. With Kronprinz Wilhelm, leader of the influential Prussian exiles, having the ear of Rupprecht, whoever he supports might well achieve dominance over the Confederation. Though some fear that Wilhelm might take the throne for himself in a bid for restoration…"
