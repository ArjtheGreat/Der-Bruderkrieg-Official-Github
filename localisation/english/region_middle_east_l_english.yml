###Persian Ottoman War
persian_ottoman_war.1.t:0 "The Shah's Speech"
persian_ottoman_war.1.d:0 "Tehran was quiet as the Shah of Perisa looked upon his loyal subjects waiting for a word to come out of the mouth of the Great Shah. He silences those whispering and speaks 5 words. "It is time for a change.", "A change in our region, to our liking. The Ottomans to our west, disgusting Sunnis and the Sunnis to our east, who occupy Balochistan and Kabul. It is time for us to take the mantle of ruler over the islamic world and dismantle the Sunni hierarchy of unfair dominance over Shias." The crowds of Tehran cheered violently as the Shah continued his speech. The Ottoman sultan had heard of the speech hours later over the airwaves, having heard the speech over Ottoman radio stations broadcasting and covering the events. The Sultan of the Ottomans, having been Caliph ever since the Caliph of Mekkah had been forced to abdicate and give his title to the Ottoman sultan years ago, would make an announcement in Konstantiyye. "My people, the Persians seem to be readying for war.. We must band together and ready for war with these Shia dogs. It's time to crush these Shiites, as they've lived in peace for far too long. Prepare for war, you "Shah".""

We shall get revenge!"\nThe Ottoman sultan had heard of the speech hours later, and would make an announcement in Konstantiyye. "My people, the Persians seem to be readying for war..

# Persia
PER_the_anglo_recession:0 "The Anglo Recession"
PER_the_anglo_recession_desc:0 "The collapse of the British economy after the Indian Revolution has badly affected Iran. Initially, we celebrated, hoping that we too could throw off economic control by the British. Instead, our economy fell with the British economy, and Prime Minister Taqizadeh refused to nationalize the British oil companies because of his westernizing ambitions. Our economy is still in the toilet and Taqizadeh is now reviled by the general population. We have to solve this crisis, or it will be the death of Persian freedom."

AFG_the_saqqawists_desc:0 "The Saqqawist Rebellion of Habibullah Kalakani never truly ended. Though they were beaten, they were not defeated, and many Saqqawist groups fight on from the countryside, backed by Pakistan. The death of Nadir Shah has only worsened the problem, as his son is not an accomplished military leader. A Second Afghan Civil War looms over Afghanistan..."
AFG_well_trained_army:0 "A Well-Trained Army"
AFG_well_trained_army_desc:0 "With the Civil War won, the Afghan army is uncommonly well experienced in semi-modern fighting. In addition, many soldiers served in the Indian Revolution. The problem is not quality, but quantity, as many soldiers either died in the fighting or support the Saqqawists, and thus don't serve the government."

OMA_the_unstable_immamate_desc:0 "After Ghalib al-Hinai came from the highlands, couped the government in Muscat, and declared the Immammate of Oman the legitimate government, our nation fell into a period of chaos. With the British threatening a possible invasion, al-Hinai quickly shored up his military and crushed all resistance. He has implemented harsh reforms, and has provided funding to the Arab rebels in New Judea. Nevertheless, the government and the king's power still remains a major question for the future of Oman."

While most of its efforts are focused on fighting the British in Bengal, the movement has spread to several Western occupations across the world, such as the fight against English expansion in Arabia by Oman, Liu Xianshi's Chinese Populist Revolution, and the Argentinian struggle against American influence."

SAU_arabian_federation_desc:0 "§YWe are a member of the Arab Tribal Federation!§!\n\nAfter the Arab Revolt in the Europakrieg and the Treaty of Vienna, the Ottomans pulled out much of their forces from Arabia and established the Arab Tribal Federation, granting us much more autonomy. We Arabs are relatively free to exchange goods and govern ourselves, but there is still a strong divide in federation between the Rashidi and the Saudi tribes. If this divide is not mended, through peace or diplomacy, our Arab dream could end forever."

JAB_ottoman_patronage:0 "Ottoman Patronage"

SAU_for_a_united_arabia_desc:0 "Arabia has been shattered for centuries, and at all costs we must unite the Peninsula! We strategically allied ourselves with the Russians and the Brother's Coalition in the First Europakrieg, and achieved autonomy in our victory. Nevertheless, the traitorous Rashidis have continued to mantain strong relations with the Ottomans, preventing us from making any big moves...that is, until a major conflict rolls around."

 EGY_weltschmerzian_apollonism_desc:0 "Coined by Austrian newspaper Die Presse, it aimed to describe the complex social dynamic of Egypt after the defeat of the Anglo-French Punitive Expidition, and the strange blend of ultrarational cynicism and masochistic defeatism that seemed to covet both rich and poor Egyptians. There were many factors to the decadent societal state of Egypt, from its corrupt leadership, to her repeated humiliations in the face of European powers. Despite that, one should always remember that the harder one pushes a ball under water, the more violent it will rebound once it is released"
 EGY_the_nile_trumvirate_desc:0 "After the Establishment of the Egyptian Protectorate under the supervision of the United Kingdom, power was relegated to three different seats of power.\n\nThe Sultan, who served as the binding figurehead who wrote bills into law, the Egyptian Parliament, a rump legislature who in reality were only propped up as a mirage of self-rule. Above these two stood the Executive Cabinet, a British-controlled council where true legislative power over Egypt was vested"
 EGY_rampant_deflation_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the tumultuous murder of Lee Stacks, European investment began drying up. As the Egyptian Pound is pegged to the British one, having been made so by the British war-cabinet, the colonial Egyptian economy is being dragged closer and closer to fiscal collapse. The truth is that the Egyptian Economy is not the British, she does not have the industry, and she does not have her machines. We must do something, anything, to resuscitate this dead corpse of an economy somehow, and do so quickly before it drags Britain down with it!"
 EGY_aftermath_of_treaty_of_suez_desc:0 "During the Anglo-French Punitive Expidition the Pashas were forced to sign The Treaty of the Suez, a deal framed to 'protect' Egyptian society and integrity, and boost the local economy. Oh, fools they were to trust them! The Treaty was nothing more than a disaster and a humiliation to Egypt and her people! Not only loosing the Suez to the European vultures, but also having her own riches stolen by greedy barons in exchange for nothing but a perpetual millitary occupation; the lands that have nurtured Egyptians for millenia being treated as nothing but a whore to be used. The fact that this Treaty exist is a detriment to our Egyptian pride!\n\n...Whatever is left of it."

SCA_paris_by_sea_desc:0 "Port Said has been a cosmopolitan port since the first swing of the pickaxe to dig the Suez. Due to that, one is sometimes lulled into believing that one isn't in Egypt, much to the dismay of the now-minority of Egyptians living there, who dream of reunification with Egypt.\nThere have been rumbles before regarding this subject, question is if this rumble will begin to quake."

These comissions are of course made up by the likes of France, The Ottomans, Austria, and more, whose representatives all must find consensus for laws to be implemented. \nWhile a beautiful thing on paper, it has prooven instead to be a system where no laws pass, and everyone is at eachother's throats."
SCA_canal_economies:0 "Canal Economies"
SCA_canal_economies_desc:0 "Ever since its inception has the Universal Company of the Maritime Canal of Suez been reliant on the profits made from the canal. Thus, the international terretory has always relied upon it, and desicions have always been made with the canal in consideration. This overreliance on the canal, as more and more people come to live beside the canal, has created an immense liability on the administration. It's usage making the country flip between the state grinding to a halt, or swimming cash. To band-aid these swings, the Suez often relies on just as wild tax-swings to offset money-drought, something quite unpopular and ineffective."
