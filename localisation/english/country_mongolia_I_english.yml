MON_GENGHIS_KHAN_THE_2ND_LEADER_DESC:0 "The Year is 1924. Word has spread around the streets of Ulaan Baatar, that the Khan was dead. Temujin was at home, listening to the news on his old radio, when he heard a knock on his door. There, a man dressed in a standard red Keshig uniform was waiting. \n"Come with me," he whisphered.\n And Temujin followed. He arrived at the royal palace, not understanding what was going on. They whisked him in in a frenzy. Waiting there was famous Russian general Roman Von Sternberg. "You will be the savior of the Mongolian monarchy. It is time to crown you Genghis Khan th3 nd," he said.\nTemujin, born in the high mountains of Mongolia, had always been an ambitious child, striving to be the best. He had read much about the great Genghis Khan. When he was 14, his parents sent him to live with his uncle in Ulaan Baatar, where he became interested in politics and the Mongolian monarchy.\nHe left education at age 18 and began working to enter the court of the Bodgh Khanate. He witnessed the crushing of the Peasent's Revolt of 1921 with the help of Von Sternberg, leading him to become a legend.\nUpon hearing the news that Bogdh Khan had had an heir, the poeple's panic dropped. Now Temujin had arrived at his coronation. People arrived in the thousands to watch his enthroning.\nOnce becoming Khan, Temujin immediatly expressed his territorial ambitions. He began a massive industrial and military build up, which weakened Mongolia's largely agarian economy. During the Chinese Collapse of 1931, he immediatly grabbed lands from the Xinjiang and Ma Cliques. He continued to improve relations with Kerensky and the Russians to secure his northern flank.\nTo this day, his ambitions run rampant. He prepares to wage war against the fractured states of China in what should be an epic final showdown. Will he be able to reform the Mongol Empire?"

MON_legacy_of_genghis_desc:0 "After Bogdh Khan’s death in 1922, with him having no heir, the Mongolian nobility feared the empty throne and with the support of the Russians placed a fake king on the throne as king to uphold the monarchy, declaring him the "reincarnation of Genghis Khan". The king was just a young boy but especially ambitious and stirred up nationalism among the people. A massive military build up occured, specializing in cavalry and speed. With China in disarray after the collapse of the Qing dynasty, the stronger Mongols took the opportunity to grab land from the newly formed East Turkestan and Ma Clique.\nThe Khan has made it his goal to reclaim as much as Genghis Khan's Empire as possible. With the chaos in China, in seems like a distant achieveable posibility."

MON_russian_army_advisors_desc:0 "Mongolian-Russian Relations have always been solid. Due to military and economic cooperations and concessions, the Kerensky government has been in strong support of the Mongolian monarchy. The throne was secured and peasents movement crushed especially because of the support of Russian General Roman Von Urgen-Sternberg. The Russians have recently been sending us advisors to train our once unprofessional army."

MON_divided_economy:0 "Divided Economy"
MON_divided_economy_desc:0 "The Khan has ordered a total militirzation of the state, modeling it after Goering's Prussian Regime. However, this has caused much rift among the people as Mongolia's economy is largely agrarian based and unwilling to shift so quickly. The Khan's wanting for radical change has deeply hurt the core of Mongolia's economy. Something must be done to resolve the situation."
