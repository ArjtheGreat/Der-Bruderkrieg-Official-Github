        DEN_traitors_of_the_revolution:0 "Traitors of the Revolution!"
       DEN_traitors_of_the_revolution_desc:0 "When our capital was lost to the enemy, what did our “protector” do? He fled the country to a faraway island, putting himself over his people. That was when we took charge, the workers in charge for the benefit of the workers. But still, even when we are helping our fellow danes, some are still blinded by the capitalist’s propaganda. We must re-teach these poor fools, in any way possible, to secure the safety of the nation and the people."

       DEN_inextinguishable_ideals:0 "Red Bastion of Europe"
       DEN_inextinguishable_ideals_desc:0 "Alone we were freed, and alone we must defend our freedom. Serving our nation, our ideals and each other is of utmost priority in order to secure our lives and our independence. For this purpose every citizen of the nation must exercise their full strength, make use of all their capabilities and if required, lay down their life for a better tomorrow. The socialist dream shall not be stopped by any force, we are an unstoppable force and an immovable object, we are Europe's Red Bastion!"

       DEN_split_in_the_parliament:0 "Split in the Folketing"
       DEN_split_in_the_parliament_desc:0 "The coalition that once salvaged Denmark from impending doom is now hanging on by the skin of its teeth. Danmarks Kommunistiske Parti (DPK), the Revolutionære Socialisters Forbund (RSF) and Socialdemokratiet (S) are split on how to run the country in the future. As a result of this infighting in parliament several reforms have been stopped dead in their tracks. This political standoff is expected to be broken by the upcoming election. If it is not, then the Union will find itself very exposed."




    ICE_royal_loyalists:0 "Royal Loyalists"
    ICE_royal_loyalists_desc:0 "A national tragedy this whole ordeal is. For a King to be exiled, separated from his people. Still his loyal subjects long for his return, and some even make the treacherous journey across the vast North Sea to support him in his attempt to recover the fatherland. This is a welcomed migration as the limited manpower of Iceland is insufficient in providing a suitable army. We are however starting to notice that not all of those arriving have our exact mindset. Still, we all share the same goal, to reclaim the fatherland!"

    ICE_military_parliament:0 "Military Government"
    ICE_military_parliament_desc:0 "With us on our journey away from the fatherland came our most trusted advisors. Together we organised and restructured the government into a more suitable one for our situation. This militaristic parliament will certainly provide ample support in our quest for reclamation. However our generals and admirals, while competent on the battlefield, are not as capable in composing economic and domestic policies. This fact is beginning to be noticed quite glaringly. How long we can keep up this imbalance in politics is uncertain, but certainly not forever."

    ICE_icelandic_populace:0 "On Thin Ice"
    ICE_icelandic_populace_desc:0 "As a result of our retreat from the red menace we have found ourselves stuck in a small corner of our former kingdom, namely Iceland. While most Icelanders are neutral towards the king, they are not as cordial with the sudden militarisation of their homeland. The radicals amongst them would like to see us forced off the island, while most others quietly accept the situation. For now at least. If our dream of reconquering the fatherland is to be realised we must first stabilise our current situation. Else the ice might break, plunging us into the freezing water below."

    


    ##norway
    NOR_policy_of_neutrality:0 "The Pact of Atlantica"
    NOR_policy_of_neutrality_desc:0 "The policy of neutrality instilled by the Pact of Atlantica has become something of a prideful thing to the Norwegians. A symbol of nationality, the neutrality and general anti-war sentiment in the country has quickly taken root. This might have had a positive effect for the minor nation's economy as an ever shrinking military has led to more able-bodied men working the factories and offices instead of serving in the field. However if the heightening tensions across Europe were to drag Norway into war the country would be miserably unprepared."
    NOR_enforced_prohibition:0 "Enforced Prohibition"
    NOR_enforced_prohibition_desc:0 "A law once hailed is now rapidly falling into its own grave. A decisive majority of the population has for the last few years been against keeping the prohibition laws, and every party in Stortinget is on the same side. With the exception of two. The two ruling parties, Arbeiderpartiet and Venstre, have somehow kept their might in parliament without having to change sides in this debate. Until now that is. It is expected that a conservative-agrarian coalition will take control if the socialists and libertarians won’t change their minds. The last chance that the ruling parties have to stay in power is to switch party policy at their next summit, otherwise their long kept control over Stortinget is soon coming to an end."
    NOR_miracle_economy:0 "The Mirakel Economy"
    NOR_miracle_economy_desc:0 "Despite its size, Norway has become a runaway economy in the last decade. Growing from a small fishing community on the edge of Europe into a soaring mix of commerce and industry. In just over ten years it has surpassed all of its neighbours in wealth per capita. Uncertain still is how lasting this rapid growth is. Is it all a random fluke or is the Norwegian economy actually as good as some say?"

        ###ideas...
        SWE_victory_on_the_battlefield:0 "Victory on the Battlefield"
        SWE_victory_on_the_battlefield_desc:0 "Hurrah! Once more we’ve been victorious on the battlefield! With this display of might, our subjects have gained trust in the government and our neighbours are shivering with fear of our military power. This resounding victory will be celebrated for years to come and the names of our soldiers and leaders will forever be glorified in our history books!"

        SWE_the_guadeloupe_issue:0 "Eftermälet av Guadeloupeöverenskommelsen"
        SWE_the_guadeloupe_issue_desc:0 "Ever since the aftermath of the Napolenoic War, Sweden has held the island of Guadeloupe. However, due to the remoteness of the island, Guadeloupe is culturally closer to its previous French rulers, with Britain still administrating it for us. Unless we assert Swedish sovreignity and dominion over the islands, the risk is that it may slip away from us; though, if used in a trade, perhaps that could be useful?"

        SWE_bondegat:0 "A Limp Economy"
        SWE_bondegat_desc:0 "It was with the support of the rural peasants that we could retake control over our beautiful country. As thanks for their help we’ve had to make some concessions to the agrarian population. These compromises on our economy have had an impact on our previous industrialization but also granted some stability amongst our people. With some adjustments to our current situation this could potentially turn our now stagnating industry to a booming, agrarian-based system. Or we could curb our supporters and force through a new industrial system to keep up with the ever growing markets of Europe."

        SWE_the_red_problem:0 "Remembering Trotsveckan"
        SWE_the_red_problem_desc:0 "The Week of Defiance is still fresh in many people's minds. And even though you might not hear it in public, at night in dark alleys and dimly lit basements activists are organising. Their struggle for the democracy of the past is still ongoing. Our action during that fateful week only polarised us from them even further, pushing more over the fence and into their camps. Someday we will have to clamp down on these subversive activities again, or they will try to slash our throats open. But we must tread carefully, for if we take a wrong turn we might just lose our heads anyways."
