###Persian Ottoman War
persian_ottoman_war.1.t:0 "The Shah's Speech"
persian_ottoman_war.1.d:0 "Tehran was quiet as the Shah of Perisa looked upon his loyal subjects waiting for a word to come out of the mouth of the Great Shah. He silences those whispering and speaks 5 words. "It is time for a change.", "A change in our region, to our liking. The Ottomans to our west, disgusting Sunnis and the Sunnis to our east, who occupy Balochistan and Kabul. It is time for us to take the mantle of ruler over the islamic world and dismantle the Sunni hierarchy of unfair dominance over Shias." The crowds of Tehran cheered violently as the Shah continued his speech. The Ottoman sultan had heard of the speech hours later over the airwaves, having heard the speech over Ottoman radio stations broadcasting and covering the events. The Sultan of the Ottomans, having been Caliph ever since the Caliph of Mekkah had been forced to abdicate and give his title to the Ottoman sultan years ago, would make an announcement in Konstantiyye. "My people, the Persians seem to be readying for war.. We must band together and ready for war with these Shia dogs. It's time to crush these Shiites, as they've lived in peace for far too long. Prepare for war, you "Shah".""

The crowds of Tehran cheered violently as the Shah continued his speech. "These foul Sunnis will be crushed under the mighty boot of the Shiites. I now declare the Caliphate of Tehounshahr! We shall get revenge!" The Ottoman sultan had heard of the speech hours later, and would make an announcement in Konstantiyye. "My people, the Persians seem to be readying for war.. We must band together and ready for war with these Shia dogs. It's time to crush these Shiites, as they've lived in peace for far too long. Prepare for war, you "Shah".""

 EGY_weltschmerzian_apollonism_desc:0 "Coined by Austrian newspaper Die Presse, it aimed to describe the complex social dynamic of Egypt after the defeat of the Anglo-French Punitive Expidition, and the strange blend of ultrarational cynicism and masochistic defeatism that seemed to covet both rich and poor Egyptians. There were many factors to the decadent societal state of Egypt, from its corrupt leadership, to her repeated humiliations in the face of European powers. Despite that, one should always remember that the harder one pushes a ball under water, the more violent it will rebound once it is released"
 EGY_the_nile_trumvirate_desc:0 "After the Establishment of the Egyptian Protectorate under the supervision of the United Kingdom, power was relegated to three different seats of power.\n\nThe Sultan, who served as the binding figurehead who wrote bills into law, the Egyptian Parliament, a rump legislature who in reality were only propped up as a mirage of self-rule. Above these two stood the Executive Cabinet, a British-controlled council where true legislative power over Egypt was vested"
 EGY_rampant_deflation_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the tumultuous murder of Lee Stacks, European investment began drying up. As the Egyptian Pound is pegged to the British one, having been made so by the British war-cabinet, the colonial Egyptian economy is being dragged closer and closer to fiscal collapse. The truth is that the Egyptian Economy is not the British, she does not have the industry, and she does not have her machines. We must do something, anything, to resuscitate this dead corpse of an economy somehow, and do so quickly before it drags Britain down with it!"
 EGY_aftermath_of_treaty_of_suez_desc:0 "During the Anglo-French Punitive Expidition the Pashas were forced to sign The Treaty of the Suez, a deal framed to 'protect' Egyptian society and integrity, and boost the local economy. Oh, fools they were to trust them! The Treaty was nothing more than a disaster and a humiliation to Egypt and her people! Not only loosing the Suez to the European vultures, but also having her own riches stolen by greedy barons in exchange for nothing but a perpetual millitary occupation; the lands that have nurtured Egyptians for millenia being treated as nothing but a whore to be used. The fact that this Treaty exist is a detriment to our Egyptian pride!\n\n...Whatever is left of it."
