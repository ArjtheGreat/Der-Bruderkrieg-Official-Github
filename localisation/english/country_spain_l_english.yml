SPR_the_regency:0 "The Regency"
SPR_the_regency_desc:0 "After the collapse of Jose De Rivera's dictatorship and the Carlist monarchy in 1931, Spain entered a brief period of anarchy. Luckily, our loyal general Jose Sanjuro gathered up a group of military generals and established a regency, quickly shoring up leftist resistance in the Pacficication Wars.\n\nSanjuri soon declared Alfonso XIII's illegitimate two-year-old child Leandro de Borbón as King of Spain, and stabilized the economy and government through the "August Proclamation". After the young king died in 1933, Sanjuro was left with no other heirs to put in power as a puppet. Today he remains a dictator, but a temporary one: Some Spanish hope to re-establish a Republic, and of course there are still those waiting for the Caudillo to restore the monarchy. The Regent must make his decision soon, or it might spell the end of Spain...."
SPR_november_reforms:0 "The November Reforms"
SPR_november_reforms_desc:0 "After the death of the young bastard king in 1933, Sanjurjo issued "The November Reforms", which outlined an extensive plan to tackle Spain's problems, and increase democracy, liberalism and expand freedoms within Spain. The reforms also instituted the Spanish Constitution of 1933, which re-established the Cortes Generales Parliament and further de-regulated Spain's economy. The November Reforms have been very popular among the people of Spain, but much work is left to be done to crush corruption and interest groups that plague Spanish society."
SPR_path_to_prsoperity:0 "The Path to Prosperity"
SPR_path_to_prsoperity_desc:0 "Sanjuro's economic reforms have brought an economic miracle to Spain, quickly bringing out of the 1933 economic crisis. After Sanjuro nationalized many resources, he could ensure employment for all Spanish workers and the productivity of the free market. His lowering of taxes on large corporations has encouraged foriegn investors to put in capital and allow Spain to undergo true industrialization. Currently, Spain is among Europe's fastest growing economies, and as long as this financial stability mantained, Sanjuro's regime should be mostly secure."
