GZC_kuomintang_defectors_desc:0 "After the Kuomintang collapse in 1930, a group of officers in the Central Chinese Provinces declared a Central Chinese Confederacy. With his army support, our glorious leader Liu Xianshi hopes to reunify China under his thumb and bring a new era of prosperity and progress. However, some former officers lurk in the shadows looking to possibly defect back to Chiang Kai Shek’s dying regime. We must watch out for their treachery until the final blow has been dealt to the Kuomintang.\n\n§ROur state will be negatively effected as long as the KMT lives on...§!"

 CHI_mass_instability_desc:0 "After the end of the Northern Expedition and fall of the Beyaing in 1928, we were affected by a wave of nationalist and anti-Chiang Kai Shek sentiment, spread by other revolts throughout the Beiyang. Many traitorous warlords and officers defected and 6 years later, only the coastal cities remained loyal to the KMT. We have been reduced to ashes, with little clear leadership, and with little faith for survival."

These sharks, the traitors in the Central Chinese Confederacy and the vicious imperialist Japanese and the growing Beyiang, could easily land the last blow and destroy our state once and for all. We must fight to save the party and China, whatever it takes."

MAN_the_harbinite_threat_desc:0 "President Zhang Juinghui’s reforms created a power struggle that forced us into a civil war with our ethnic Russian population. In 1929, the civil war ended, and we signed an armistice splitting our nations. We must tread the line so we do not antagonize the great Russian Bear on our northern border."
