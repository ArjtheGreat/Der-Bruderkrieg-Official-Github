##Constitutional Republic of China
CRE_liberty_guiding_light:0 "Liberty's Guiding Light"
CRE_liberty_guiding_light_desc:0 "In a region still healing from four-decade-old scars and the reasons for them not entirely gone, we are a shining example of equality. Our citizens enjoy more privileges than practically any other nation on the continent, and our leaders truly reflect the people's intent. Some will rise to challenge this, inevitably, but their success will be determined based on what is best for the nation and its inhabitants. Republicanism will prevail!"
CRE_unrest_sichuan:0 "Unrest in Sichuan"
CRE_unrest_sichuan_desc:0 "Sichuan has always been a thorn in our side. Though needed for the strategic location it possesses, we have reluctantly been forced to admit that our system of government simply cannot operate efficiently within the province. In light of this, we have rewarded our military commanders with commanderies over the province to ensure their loyalty and maintain the province's stability. Whether either goal is successful remains to be seen; whispers of unruliness have drifted out through the mountain passes, telling of a mysterious group known as the "Spirit Soldiers"."
CRE_american_aid:0 "American Aid"
CRE_american_aid_desc:0 "The Americans supply us with a flow of cash when it's urgently needed, advisors to develop our economy, and military personnel who have partially modernized our army. We are their most dependable ally in China, and our relationship is practically a unique one - born of shared ideological ground, rather than cold practicality."
##Great Ming
MNG_spurious_claim:0 "A Spurious Claim"
MNG_spurious_claim_desc:0 "Zhu Yuxun may have declared himself the Chenghua Emperor, celebrating his "accomplished change", but a realistic look - or any look - at the situation reveals him to be Emperor in name only. He does not control the walls of the Forbidden City, and his power rests upon the loyalty of furtive sects, criminal gangs, and scheming court factions. Furthermore, as a leader who permitted the political exile of some of his crucial supporters, his credibility is rather low; this is not helped by the Yellow Sand Society acting in his name across the border to the north. Though their goals align, curtailing their activities would increase his status as a legitimate contender for the Dragon Throne. Soon he must make a play for Beijing, or risk the lands he presides over slipping from his grasp. But is the army truly ready?"
MNG_illicit_connections:0 "Illicit Connections"
MNG_illicit_connections_desc:0 "The Tiandihui and Yellow Sand Society have friends across much of China, though they're only active in and around the eastern portions of the country. Though a political liability for a would-be dynasty to utilize this, it does grant the Ming a certain advantage in both antagonizing and collecting information about their enemies."
MNG_american_aid:0 "American Aid"
MNG_american_aid_desc:0 "The Americans supply us with a flow of cash when it's urgently needed, advisors to develop our economy, and military personnel who modernized our army. In exchange, we protect their rights to Shanghai and the American citizens within, who increase our own economic output. We may cry out "Down with the West!", but as long as they know their place within our country we have all the benefits and none of the drawbacks."

##Qing Empire
QNG_tale_two_dragons:0 "A Tale of Two Dragons"
QNG_tale_two_dragons_desc:0 "390 years ago, as the once-mighty Ming was falling apart, our Manchu ancestors rode through the gates of Shanhai to restore the Mandate of Heaven to the rightful dynasty. Now, these "Great Ming" upstarts to our south have damaged our reputation as the true monarch of China. The longer the Ming exists, the more our legitimacy is challenged. The fact that the Ming capital of Yingtian is right across the Yangtze is a certain sign that the Ming claimants are actively challenging the Mandate of Heaven. We must act quickly, lest more Han citizens turn against us."
QNG_yellow_sands:0 "The Yellow Sands"
QNG_yellow_sands_desc:0 "The Yellow Sand Society, supporters of the illegitimate Ming, have caused havoc and chaos in our lands by damaging infrastructure, making our law enforcement run in circles, and co-opting local people into joining their movements. Though they have not succeeded in causing any major crisis, if we do not deal with them soon they could be a major thorn in our side and lead to political difficulties."
QNG_modern_empire:0 "A Modern Empire"
QNG_modern_empire_desc:0 "Despite our internal problems, we have successfully brought our realm to westernized and industrialized nation from a medieval state chained to the past. The armies are drilled with the most modern Western tactics, while brilliant minds from all 4 corners of our empire fill the halls of our university. While the benefits are immense, there are also consequences to the rapid modernization. Our inner provinces are now severely lagging behind whilst some figures are starting to question our nation’s increasing reliance on Westerners."

##Xibei Sultanate
XSM_northwestern_horses:0 "The Northwestern Horses"
XSM_northwestern_horses_desc:0 "Four are the Northwestern Horses: Ma Buqing, Ma Bufang, Ma Zhongying, and Ma Lin. Together - or, more often, separately - they govern the lands of the Xibei. Despite these close family ties, however, not all is well amongst the Ma. Ma Lin and Ma Bufang are well known for their fierce rivalry, and Ma Zhongying is the black sheep of the family. Only Ma Buqing is without personal rivals, but you need not hate a man to depose him. If he cannot keep his unruly relatives in check, he may find himself supplanted by someone who can."
XSM_yihewani_influence:0 "Yihewani Influence"
XSM_yihewani_influence_desc:0 "Ma Qi’s family has continued to endorse the fundamentalist Yihewani (Ikhwan) sect of Sunni Islam. While this gives their decisions and policies more legitimacy, it also offends less extreme Muslims as well as non-Muslims; the Yihewani are not always gentle in spreading their faith, though they are technically unaffiliated from the government’s operations. In practice, however, the Ma tacitly approve of their activities and do not interfere."
XSM_ethnic_tensions:0 "Ethnic Tensions"
XSM_ethnic_tensions:0 "Tibetans, Mongols, Han and Hui - the Xibei Sultanate hardly has a unified base of support. In particular the Hui, Chinese Muslims who make up the government and about half of Xibei’s population, are often at odds with their unconverted or ethnically distinct neighbors. While we could potentially try to resolve the issue by encouraging the Hui to be Han first and Muslims second, some fear this would likely extinguish our people’s unique and long-established culture. The problems will not end anytime soon."
#decisions
china_worldbuilding_decisions:0 "Chinese Politics"
china_worldbuilding_decisions_desc:0 "The geopolitics of China are always shifting, and nations shift along with them. For us to determine our destiny, we must seize all opportunities that come our way - and not fail to achieve our objectives, or else we might face our enemies sooner than planned."
XSM_tibetan_war:0 "The Tibetan War"
XSM_tibetan_war_desc:0 "Tibet is a comparatively undeveloped nation, but we should nonetheless approach it with some caution. Failure to conquer it swiftly enough would surely be our downfall at the hands of our southern enemies..."
XSM_xinjiang_war:0 "The Xinjiang Conquest"
XSM_xinjiang_war:0 "Xinjiang has always been in a weak state militarily; though able to draw upon a not-unimpressive amount of men, they are invariably conscripts and poorly trained with little equipment. Still, failure to conquer it swiftly enough would surely be our downfall at the hands of our southern enemies..."
## Xinjiang
XNJ_grandfather_governor:0 "The Grandfather Governor"
XNJ_grandfather_governor_desc:0 "Yang Zengxin has maintained the Confederation for decades now, but because of its nature he could never centralize and effectively rule it. Upon his death, the former Qing province will lose all direction and authority: Yang has no chosen successor, and the disunited peoples would never bow to some unproven man "elected" in Dihua. Yang may have entered his final year, as has Xinjiang…"
XNJ_accursed_confederation:0 "The Accursed Confederation"
XNJ_accursed_confederation_desc:0 "Kazakhs and Kyrgyz, Uyghurs and Hui, Mongols and Tibetans -  Yang has managed to pull together all this from what might well have been nothing, without his rapid action. The last remaining leader from the War of National Salvation (despite his technically never seeing action), his fall signifies the end of an era for the region and the province. Old paths will no longer be sufficient to curb the political awareness of a growingly conscious population, and those who clung to them are fading. While it lasts, however, the curious arrangement he created is not without its benefits."

#tibet
TIB_feudal_nation:0 "Feudal Nation"
TIB_feudal_nation_desc:0 "Our society is headed completely by the Dalai Lama and his nobility, who own all the property. Meanwhile, the majority of our people farm land for the aristocrats and live of sustenance farming. With the conflict in China brewing, we must industrialize quick or it could spell the end of our new Empire."
TIB_pan_tibetanism:0 "Pan-Tibetan Revival"
TIB_pan_tibetanism_desc:0 "After the collapse of China, the 13th Dalai Lama Thubten Gyatso quickly seized the opportunity to seize ethnic Tibetan lands in South-Central China. The new incorporation of ethnic Tibetan peoples brought a wave of nationalism throughout the country, and ideas of a new Tibetan Empire have spread throughout the kingdom."

tibet_expansion.1.t:0 "The Declaration of Greater Tibet"
tibet_expansion.1.d:0 "Today, Tibetan nationalists in the capital Lhasa declared the formation of a new Greater Tibet.\n\nThey have claimed the realm of the Ma Clique and Bhutan, where the democratic Tibetan Republicans reside in exile. With the great war raging in Europe and distracting the major European Imperial powers, Tibet is seizing the opportunity to expand their borders. The Prussians have already announced their support for Tibet's National Revolution and the formation of a Tibetan Volksgemeinschaft."

##mongolia
MON_legacy_of_genghis:0 "Legacy of Genghis"
MON_legacy_of_genghis_desc:0 "After Bogdh Khan's death in 1922, with him having no heir, the Mongolian nobility feared the empty throne and with the support of the Russians placed a fake king on the throne as king to uphold the monarchy, declaring him the "reincarnation of Genghis Khan". The king was just a young boy but especially ambitious and stirred up nationalism among the people. A massive military build up occured, specializing in cavalry and speed. With China in disarray after the collapse of the Qing dynasty, the stronger Mongols took the opportunity to grab land from the newly formed East Turkestan and Ma Clique.\nThe Khan has made it his goal to reclaim as much as Genghis Khan's Empire as possible. With the chaos in China, in seems like a distant achieveable posibility."
    
MON_russian_army_advisors:0 "Russian Army Advisors"
MON_russian_army_advisors_desc:0 "Mongolian-Russian Relations have always been solid. Due to military and economic cooperations and concessions, the Kerensky government has been in strong support of the Mongolian monarchy. The throne was secured and peasents movement crushed especially because of the support of Russian General Roman Von Urgen-Sternberg. The Russians have recently been sending us advisors to train our once unprofessional army."

MON_divided_economy:0 "Divided Economy"
MON_divided_economy_desc:0 "The Khan has ordered a total militirzation of the state, modeling it after Goering's Prussian Regime. However, this has caused much rift among the people as Mongolia's economy is largely agrarian based and unwilling to shift so quickly. The Khan's wanting for radical change has deeply hurt the core of Mongolia's economy. Something must be done to resolve the situation."

MON_GENGHIS_KHAN_THE_2ND_LEADER_DESC:0 "The Year is 1924. Word has spread around the streets of Ulaan Baatar, that the Khan was dead. Temujin was at home, listening to the news on his old radio, when he heard a knock on his door. There, a man dressed in a standard red Keshig uniform was waiting. \n"Come with me," he whisphered.\n And Temujin followed. He arrived at the royal palace, not understanding what was going on. They whisked him in in a frenzy. Waiting there was famous Russian general Roman Von Sternberg. "You will be the savior of the Mongolian monarchy. It is time to crown you Genghis Khan th3 nd," he said.\nTemujin, born in the high mountains of Mongolia, had always been an ambitious child, striving to be the best. He had read much about the great Genghis Khan. When he was 14, his parents sent him to live with his uncle in Ulaan Baatar, where he became interested in politics and the Mongolian monarchy.\nHe left education at age 18 and began working to enter the court of the Bodgh Khanate. He witnessed the crushing of the Peasent's Revolt of 1921 with the help of Von Sternberg, leading him to become a legend.\nUpon hearing the news that Bogdh Khan had had an heir, the poeple's panic dropped. Now Temujin had arrived at his coronation. People arrived in the thousands to watch his enthroning.\nOnce becoming Khan, Temujin immediatly expressed his territorial ambitions. He began a massive industrial and military build up, which weakened Mongolia's largely agarian economy. During the Chinese Collapse of 1931, he immediatly grabbed lands from the Xinjiang and Ma Cliques. He continued to improve relations with Kerensky and the Russians to secure his northern flank.\nTo this day, his ambitions run rampant. He prepares to wage war against the fractured states of China in what should be an epic final showdown. Will he be able to reform the Mongol Empire?"
