 CHI_mass_instability_desc:0 "After the end of the Northern Expedition and fall of the Beyaing in 1928, we were affected by a wave of nationalist and anti-Chiang Kai Shek sentiment, spread by other revolts throughout the Beiyang. Many traitorous warlords and officers defected and 6 years later, only the coastal cities remained loyal to the KMT. We have been reduced to ashes, with little clear leadership, and with little faith for survival."
