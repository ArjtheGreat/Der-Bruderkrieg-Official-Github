 sweden.1.d:0 "Following the Ådalen shootings in 1931, the labor movement has grown more and more restless by the year, and things have finally come to a head, with a nearly nation-wide strike breaking out due to mistreatment of workers in Central Sweden factories.\n\nNot wanting a repeat of the Ådalen shootings, Sven Hedin has refused to let the military respond to the strikes, in spite of growing pressure from the far right to violently suppress the strikes.\n\nThe [SWE.GetFascistParty] has promised to support Gustav V if he seizes even greater powers to force the military to crush the strikes."

 sweden.2.d:0 "Due to the lack of capabilities from the [SWE.GetNeutralParty] to crush the strikes that have occurred throughout most of [SWE.GetNameDef], Gustav V has enacted a self-coup by dismissing the Prime Minister and empowering the [SWE.GetFascistParty] to help him rule the nation, violently putting down the strikers."

SWE_swedish_student_revolt.1.t:0 "Students Organize In Gothenburg"
SWE_swedish_student_revolt.1.d:0 "Recently the police in Gothenburg were informed about several student groups within the universities of the city discussing ideas, ideas not only focused on their studies. As it seems a large portion of these groups are centred around reformation of the political system of the country. Of course reform can, sometimes, be useful. But to the extent that these youngsters are rumoured to discuss is completely improper. Shutting them down immediately might be the best option as they have yet not become well known outside of their own little bubble. Still there would be backlash, but hopefully to a lesser extent than if we let them grow."

SWE_swedish_student_revolt.2.d:0 "Several student groups from the different universities of Gothenburg have recently begun to organise and today cooperated in a major protest along the streets of the city. For the last hour important traffic routes going from the large harbour have halted as the students occupy the streets. This show of defiance must be ended quickly lest it get out of hand, as it did in 1933. Weighing the options available the police are considering forcefully removing the protesters, but such a move must be accepted by the director of the region.\n\nPondering the question he finds it difficult to make a decision, he knows it will make or break his career. To have this shut down quickly would of course be ideal, his higher ups would be impressed - but do he dare use such brute force? His predecessor won’t ever be forgotten for his choice, to have the same happen to himself would be utterly unfortunate the director thinks to himself. Perhaps it won’t even be necessary, after all this is no way near the size of the protests in 1933. This time it’s only a group of students, most won’t even pay any attention to them, will they? Finally he comes to the conclusion that..."

SWE_swedish_student_revolt.3.t:0 "City in Riot"
SWE_swedish_student_revolt.3.d:0 "Not soon after the order was given, brawls between the law and the rioters broke out on the streets of Gothenburg. Several were detained, some first after getting their noses broken. Soon the clashes grew in size as sympathetic bystanders joined in, trying to save the young dissidents from potential jail time. However the police soon managed to salvage the situation and corner the large mob within a few blocks of the city. Commerce has been able to pick up on a smaller scale throughout the rest of the city, but still the rioters are holding out. The director of the police is contemplating his choices. Should they be forced out of their barricades or should an attempt to negotiate with them be made first?"

SWE_swedish_student_revolt.4.t:0 "Revolution!"
SWE_swedish_student_revolt.4.d:0 "An unprecedented state of chaos has been reached in Sweden. The southern parts of the country are now in open conflict with the royal administration in Stockholm. The unfortunate events in Gothenburg last week was the final push that brought the instability needed for insurgent organisations to rise and take control. Although they have large popular support on their own turf a large portion of the country still stands by the king's side. Some out of honest support, others out of fear of what might happen to those revolting once the state's loyal army descends upon them. Right now any kind of diplomatic solution appears unattainable and it seems only with bloodshed will the country once more be united. If it be by the monarchy or the revolutionaries we will have to wait and see..."
