AUSTRIA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Austro-Prussian War ended in 1868. Our glorious victory proved absolutism to be the right path. After defending the liberty of the South German states, we thought it only right that they reorganize themselves to our liking. The Prussians tried again to beat us along with the Italians and Russians, but failed to do so as we managed a stalemate against all odds. But the separatists still hadn't learn their lesson. In 1923, the Magyars revolted, soaking the Empire in blood for 3 years. But we triumphed yet again, and maintained tradition. By now, though, opposition has reached a breaking point between the Czechs, Italians and Hungarians. The Empire is in chaos, but Austria erit in orbe ultima."

KARL_DESC:0 "Karl I was born in the castle of Persenbeug in 1887, the Emperor Franz Joseph's great nephew. His childhood was pampered, but after the death of Franz Joseph is 1889, Karl was third-in-line for the throne after now-Kaiser Rudolf and his uncle Franz Ferdinand. Over time, Karl developed a reactionary, military attitude. After the Chotek Scandal in 1899, Franz Ferdinand distanced himself from the Royal Family, leaving Karl now second-in-line. The same year, he met his future wife, Zita of Bourbon-Parma, though they were both children. Karl was enrolled as an officer in the Imperial Army, and seemed headed for a long, absolutist career. He was married to Zita in 1911, and she gave birth to Otto in 1912. Then came the Europakrieg.\n\nKarl frequently clashed with Conrad von Hotzendorf, but since in the military his only allies were Croats, he was isolated by the Austrian noble high command. Conrad convinced the aging emperor that the heir should not be on the front lines and Karl was recalled, just in time for Rudolf to die in 1916. Karl reconciled with Franz Ferdinand and his Slavophile party, sending his uncle to the Bavarian front while he consolidated political support. Through his widespread popularity as a new emperor, he was able to maintain imperial stability and conclude a decent peace. In the wake of the defeat, Karl used his Slavophile backing to reform the army, expelling the incompetent Austrian nobility such as Hotzendorf. Though many hoped that Karl would then reform the Empire in a liberal direction, he reformed the absolutist system, making it more Catholic and meritocratic. The government was not corrupt or inefficient, nor was the army, but Karl's popularity sank outside of Austria and Croatia. In Hungary, this decline was so precipitous, owing to the Emperor's support for minority nationalities with the Crown of St. Stephen, that a full-blown revolution began in 1923, lasting until 1926. The war killed 300,000 people and devastated Hungary further, but did prove the effectiveness of the reformed Austrian army. Karl sought a path which would ensure the system's effectiveness without threatening its stability, and thus won anger from the nobility and minorities alike. He was beloved by the Austrian people though, for his Catholic Social programs and his education reforms.\n\nIn response to the recent assassination of Minister of the Interior Kurt Schussnigg by a Czech nationalist, Karl closed the Bohemian Diet, provoking angry protests. Austria seems ready to explode, but Karl has never shied from decisive action. Karl leads Austria through these chaotic times."

The Prussians had been funding operations increasingly since Goering siezed power, blowing up Austrian garrisons on the SGC border and often brutally torturing the survivors.\n\n"And this one stung. Major Josef Lietner was struck down. He was one of your favorites, if I recall correctly your majesty?"\n\nKarl felt a lump growing in his throat. Karl had met Lietner when he had been visiting the Theresian Academy. He and Lietner had taken an instant liking to each other, and they often hunted or boxed together during leisure time. He felt a sudden rush of anger. "Those fucking cunts! How dare they! Mobilize the troops and prepare the Airf-"\n\n"Mein Kaiser! Control yourself! Are you trying to start another Europa Krieg?? Remember, Prussia this time will be more prepared. Because of that shitty piece of paper the Treaty of Vienna our army is being screwed over! Before mindlessly rushing into any more wars against the Prussians, we will have to construct an actual armed forces!"\n\nKarl banged his fist on the table,  a hit so powerful that his coffee to spill on the floor. "They might have gotten us this time", Karl shouted. "But they won't get us the next!"\n\nHe left the room The mug shattered on the floor. Soon the Concert of Europe will as well."

He had more important matters to attend to, like his fencing practice.\n\n"The nationalist bloc is a fierce enemy. As we all know, they are secretly being funded by Prussia. Naturally, it would make sense for you to fund us then, correct?"\n\nKarl studied the man carefully, realizing he had a point. He remembered Lietner and how the Prussians had brutally murdered him.

The two competing parties are the Christian Social Union (CSU) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP). The CSU advocates for a strong, Catholic, conservative state, while the SDP focuses more on welfare.\n\nHowever, policy is not the only issue; the CSU advocates for strengthening the Kaiser's role in the government, while the SDP wants a less powerful Kaiser.\n\nCurrently, the CSU is in power, but due to the recent strifes of the economy the SDP has been gaining heavily.

He looked like a stylish man, his hair and moustache made him look like a crazy but very creative person.\n\nSitting down on the comfy reclining chair, the Great Emperor asked the painter a brief question. "What's your name?"\n\nThe painter quickly replied: "Adolf Hitler, your Majesty."\n\n"All good, Adolf. I have a quest for you. Can you please show a portrait of yours?"\n\n"Of course Majesty, of course I can," Hitler replied with great enthusiasm, showing the beaming smile hidden by the slight mustache.\n\nHitler heaved his painting up to a stand.

The Anglos stand in defeat as the continent celebrates their defeat.\n\nIt started a month earlier. As the Vienna Cups were beginning, many on the island were hopeful for an Anglo victory in the sport they themselves created. Any other outcome, it was believed, would lead to national embarrassment. The events began as was expected, with the Danish, Italian, Spanish, and Italian teams taking leads in their brackets and moving onto the semi-finals. As the semi-finals began, the crowd had a great uproar for their home team, the English. Using tactics that can be described as less than fair, they emerged victorious over the Danish team. Earlier, the Italian team secured a victory over the Spanish team, but was utterly disappointing in this venture.\n\nFinally it was time for the finals, the English vs the Italians. Each side of the stadium was excited for their team, with the English being the most excited for the event. This was mainly due to Italy's poor performance in the semi-finals, which was seen as a sign that the English would easily defeat them in this final match and take home the victory. However, the arrogance of the English has led to their downfall, with both teams stagnating during the game. By the end of it, both the English and Italians had a tie score, 1-1. Penalty kicks would decide who won the contest between these two teams. In a huge upset for the English, the Italians barely scraped out a victory."

The Austrian Empire, born in the ashes of the Napoleonic Wars, was dominating Europe outwardly. But inside, it was full of rot. The revolutions of 1848 nearly burned our empire to the ground, but Franz Joseph I, Der Alter Kaiser, saved us from revolution, though Hungary would continue to be a problem. After the treacherous Prussians backstabbed us to unite Germany, we put them and Italy down, seizing land and dominance in Germany. We were mortified to see ultranationalist regimes rise in both countries, and even more mortified when they, combined with Russia, invaded us and the Ottomans. We were pushed back almost to Vienna, but our skilled army, never wanting to bend to the Prussian scum, counterattacked with vengeance and saved the Empire. It was truly the old against the new, and while we nearly lost, we still stand as the preeminent power thanks to the Russian March Revolution and our forcing of a stalemate on Prussia. (Note - it would be March in Austrian calendar) We crushed Bela Kun's traitorous revolution in Hungary in the 20s, but under the rule of Kaiser Karl I, the regionalist issues have begun to resurface. The Empire is buckling under the weight of its subjects, and with the storm clouds of war brewing, only time can tell whether our Empire will hold"

"Introductions?" the man at the head asked. "Pal Pronay," the wild man answered. The bald man, looking with distrust at Pronay, responded, "Matyas Rakoczi."

He walked up and shook Rupprecht's hand, as the other man's glare intensified. Karl walked up to him. "Well met, sir," he declaimed. "This is the Count von Rundstedt," his aide whispered. I should have known, Karl thought. His debriefings had identified Rundstedt as a major rival to Austrian control. He would have to remember that.\n\nWith the Emperor introduced and taking a seat, the furious debate continued. One minister shouted angrily, "We are your allies, not your puppets!" Franz stood up and angrily demanded the man be sacked, prompting an outburst. Rundstedt stood up, gruffly stating that the army would stand behind their king.\n\nFranz stood up to reply, but Karl cut him off. "Of course, Count, the army will stand by their king. I would expect no less. I request the King to exert his authority over his subjects, which the Count von Rundstedt has so clearly reminded us of, to ensure a civil discourse." Rupprecht stood up. "Yes, indeed, men, calm yourselves." The old man took him aside.\n\n"Emperor, your - your ambassador, such as he is, is not fostering the unity of our 70 year alliance. I-I must insist that he moderate his tone or be recalled." "Oh?" Karl wondered aloud. "What has the Archduke done to displease you, King?" "Man, did you not see the court?" the king demanded. So much for civil discourse, Karl thought. "Mind your tone, sir, or-" Or the army will mind it for you, Karl didn't say. It was clear what he meant. The Emperor tried another tack. "You have been a good and faithful ally of the Empire for 70 years, as you said, and I assure you that all the Archduke wishes to accomplish is for the endurance of the alliance." "Emperor," Rupprecht said, in grudging acceptance of Karl's tact, "He can fill the civil service and army with cronies, but not the people. You remember the Hungarian Revolution." Watching Karl wince, he asked, "Do you want that in our land, in the Confederation I've sworn to defend?"\n\nKarl, shocked, said, "Surely it isn't so bad." In response, the old king escorted him to a window. He saw red flags, black flags, general anarchy, and worst of all, Prussian banners. "Mein Gott," he said.

There, the Czech marshal Snedjarek was waiting for him.\n\nKarl asked him about the stability of the Confederation, where he confirmed what Rupprecht had said. Franz looked sheepish, but the time for demanding answers from him wasn't now. Instead, Karl looked at Snedjarek, saying, "You know the Prussians and the South Germans, and how they fight. If a large scale popular insurrection happened during a war with Prussia, do you think the army could fight them off?" He was hoping for a yes, but expecting what came next. Immediately Snedjarek and Rundstedt both stated that it would likely be impossible. Karl turned to the Count. "Count, what would you suggest be done?" Rundstedt answered promptly, with Karl thinking that he must be a good officer. "You must strengthen the local army and ensure it isn't infiltrated, you must dismiss the good Archduke, institute social programs to appease the mob, and hunt down bandit rebels immediately. Do it quickly, Goring's agents are already trying to infiltrate my exile units." Karl turned to Franz Ferdinand, who bellowed angrily, "Nephew, dismissing me will be the end of Austrian power here! We are the senior partner in this alliance, and this will show weakness! It will cause more problems than it solves!"\n\nKarl turned to Snedjarek, who looked thoughtful. He was a conservative, but also a military officer and a pragmatist. He said, "I truly am not sure which course would be better, but my Emperor, you must choose between them.
