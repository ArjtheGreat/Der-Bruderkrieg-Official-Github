 ALB_young_republic_desc:0 "Our nation, Albania, was formed in 1878 after the Ottoman collapse in the Balkans as a monarchy. During the Europakrieg, the Austrians and Russians crossed the border from Greece and Serbia and occupied our lands. After the Russians pulled out of the war, they negotiated with Vienna to create the new Albanian Republic, led by Fan Noli. In addition, the Austrians would hold the port of Vlore and the Greeks would annex Northern Epirus. Noli has introduced reforms to counter political instability and resistance from socialists, but the Republic is still struggling to survive."
