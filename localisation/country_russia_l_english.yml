 KERENSKY_DESC:0 "Alexander Fyodorovich Kerensky is the quintessential radical democrat. Having joined the republican-leaning left wing of the Constitutional Democrats, he moderated his tone after the Tsar gave the Duma significant power, deciding that a powerless Tsar was no different than not having one. With the rise of the Workers Movement, support for Kerensky, a social democrat, grew, and he won election to the prime ministership in the VI State Duma. He has been in this office since, making Russia into a republic in all but name and preventing a Bolshevik takeover. His large scale coalition of liberal and social democrats has held together, but has become increasingly divided over the economic future of Russia and the peasant-worker divide. Kerensky’s support has dwindled in free-market liberal circles for his social programs, and it remains to be seen whether his ideal of a democratic republic for the people will stand the test of time."

 RUSSIA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In 1878, we Russians helped our Orthodox brethren liberate themselves from Ottoman tyranny. But the failures of the Tsar to win the Eastern War caused a Revolution in 1905. The Constitution of 1905 effectively surrendered most of the Tsar’s power, included labor rights, and ensured democracy. Russian politics have been pretty harmonious, and the East, not the West, is now the bastion of democracy. Long live Russia, united and free!"

SOV_ethnic_conflicts_desc:0 "Ethnic conflicts in our country are extremely prominent, with the Ukrainians and Novorossiyans (Little Russians), the Byelorussians and Lithuanians, and the Russians and Nenetsy. The rising instability and political radicalization has allowed conflict between ethnic groups fester under the skin of the Republic.\n\nThe ethnic conflict occurs mostly in Eastern Ukraine, between Ukrainian Militias and Novorossiyan Militias fighting for control over land and committing acts of terrorism including bombings, massacres and assassinating government officials in support of either group. In addition, Byelorussians are in conflict over land in the Baltic Confederation, with Lithuanians who make up a small minority within Byelorussia. They have seen themselves to be subject to brutal pogroms, killings and lynchings of the 'disgusting' and 'heretical Lithuanian catholics'. Finally, the Nenetsy have found themself being genocided by fellow Russians under the public eye. The conflicts are a huge problem for our chaotic nation, and we must find a solution to survive."

He has also enacted strict prohibitionist and anti-corruption policies. Lenin and Tsereteli are very close to tearing the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, RSDLP, in half in their tug of war for direct control over the RSDLP coalition member parties.

An increase of Conservatives and Nationalists have been on the rise in Russia, and especially in the Army. More and more conservatives join the ranks and the ranks of the officers, creating a political conflict in the army. Politicians have been fiercely debating about the situation in the army for years now, as many in the Left-Wing believe the conservatives in the army a threat to Russian democracy, the Republic, and the government. This is for good reason. After all, the officers have the most power. And when you take up the throne of power, the throne acts on you..."

Most of which have been the Turkish groups in our nation, mostly based in Samsunta and even our capital, Trebizond. But, they've been rapidly filing out as they had once made up half of our nation's population. Still, there is a small amount of them still left, making up a minority of our population, who continue to criticize us. We have been keeping them quiet for now with occasional nationalist rally, and the political suppression of Turkish nationalist parties, but this still takes up a portion of our funds. Some have even taken to the streets to resist our rule, but most of which have been shunned and some assaulted by Pontic Greek nationalists supporting a second Trapzuntine Empire."

Many of them have flocked to our country seeking work and protection from the Turkish nationalist groups and Ottoman armies who trample our shared homeland and slaughter our people. This has actually been anything but a burden, as our widely popular Greek ethnic nationalist groups have announced the support for our state due to our willingness to take in Greeks fleeing political oppression within Anatolia, and has bolstered our workforce with new young Greeks, seeking asylum!"

Yet, their opinion of us being a puppet state is in fact true, we must attempt to resist Russian influence in our government if we wish for true independence, but at least try to reconcile relations if our relations are hurt by this."
