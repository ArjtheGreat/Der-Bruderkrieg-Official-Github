 KERENSKY_DESC:0 "Alexander Fyodorovich Kerensky is the quintessential radical democrat. Having joined the republican-leaning left wing of the Constitutional Democrats, he moderated his tone after the Tsar gave the Duma significant power, deciding that a powerless Tsar was no different than not having one. With the rise of the Workers Movement, support for Kerensky, a social democrat, grew, and he won election to the prime ministership in the VI State Duma. He has been in this office since, making Russia into a republic in all but name and preventing a Bolshevik takeover. His large scale coalition of liberal and social democrats has held together, but has become increasingly divided over the economic future of Russia and the peasant-worker divide. Kerensky’s support has dwindled in free-market liberal circles for his social programs, and it remains to be seen whether his ideal of a democratic republic for the people will stand the test of time."

 RUSSIA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In 1878, we Russians helped our Orthodox brethren liberate themselves from Ottoman tyranny. But the failures of the Tsar to win the Eastern War caused a Revolution in 1905. The Constitution of 1905 effectively surrendered most of the Tsar’s power, included labor rights, and ensured democracy. Russian politics have been pretty harmonious, and the East, not the West, is now the bastion of democracy. Long live Russia, united and free!"
