IRELAND_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0"With Britain having a massacre from the Indian independence movement in 1919 the country was divided. Irish nationalists saw an opportunity to finally declare their Independence. Just like in our timeline the irish won but instead of two factions against and for the treaty with britain already weakened state britain agreed to an ultimatum in 1930 as most of ireland was being occupied in addition to india pretty much being lost so to the british it wasn't worth the manpower or effort. The Anglo Irish “Treaty” was ratified on 6 December 1930. The national referendum passed and Ireland became The free irish state. But trouble was brewing as the newly formed state struggled to keep the peace in northern ireland where british and irish protestant and christian communities clashed in our timeline this was exaggerated as the irish didn’t get any outside help in ww1 unlike in our timeline so the hold on irish values was higher. And so not soon after The National Referendum was held there was an uprising  in 1930 in Northern Ireland to become independent and it succeeded. The Free Northern Irish State also declared it’s church to be the righteous one supported by god. The new irish state still was too weak after the war to do anything about it and britain didn't protest as it would make Ireland weaker and give the british a potential puppet with many having loyalty to the church of england. Now After all these years it is time to unite Ireland forever! The first elections were held in 4 January 1931 resulting in the Victory of the Conservative Party for 6 years. "
