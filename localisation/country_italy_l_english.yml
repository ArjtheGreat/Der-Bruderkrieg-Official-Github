BENITO_MUSSOLINI_DESC:0 "§g§GBenito Mussolini§! was born in Predappio in 1883. He immigrated from Austria to Italy by way of Young Italy, and became an editor of the leftist newspaper, Avanti! However, he was expelled from the PSI for his support of the Europa Krieg, and began organizing bands of nationalistic youth. It was then that he met §CJulius Evola§! and §OFilippo Marinetti§!, who would define his ideological beliefs. Mussolini joined Evola’s §Coccultist traditionalism§! with Marinetti’s §Oatheist futurism§! to produce an ideology glorifying §Gwar§!, §Gstrength§!, and §GItaly§!.\n\nWith the peace a humiliating betrayal of Italy, Mussolini railed against the left, and North Italy exploded into violence during the §RBiennio Rosso§!, which ended when he seized control of Florence. He gave up many of his futurist principles to make the King appoint him prime minister, which would cause a break with §OMarinetti§!. But, unbeknownst to him, his friend §CEvola§! struck up §Wa friendship with the King§!, who agreed with his radical traditionalist ideas. Mussolini, unaware of the defection of his friends, settled into government. The Grand Fascist Council superseded Parliament and the Acerbo Law granted Mussolini full control. Mussolini’s main enemy was the §Rsocialists§!, divided between the Radicals led by §RAntonio Gramsci§! and Moderates led by §RFerrucio Parri§!. Mussolini initiated §GLa Rinascita§!, a program to promote Italian culture and eliminate socialists. Socialist Leader Giacomo Matteoti was assassinated which sparked outrage and riots that nearly provoked his dismissal, but §CEvola§! convinced the King that the Reds were worse than Mussolini. But, §WVictor Emanuel§!, fearing the socialist reaction and looking to undermine Mussolini, forbade him from purging the Moderates. The king forced Mussolini to adopt “non-violence,” and compliance with the MSVN Blackshirts was permitted.\n\nMussolini hoped that these reforms would cement his rule, but they undermined it. He naively believed he had the Victor's support, while the King and §CEvola§! were plotting to make the latter Prime Minister. §RThe fascist economic boom ended§! as the combination of futurism, syndicalism, and corporatism caused economic instability. §RParri’s support only grew,§! despite MSVN control. But by far the greatest threat was in his own party, divided in four. The first were the §OFuturists§!, enraged at Mussolini for compromising. Then §CEvola’s wing§! of the party, feigning loyalty to Mussolini while planning his downfall with the King. The third were §Bconservatives§! who had joined the party to destroy socialism but were disloyal to fascism. The fourth faction were §Gloyal to Il Duce§! and could be counted on. He still had broad popular support, but many plotted his downfall.\n\nIn 1936, Mussolini remains unaware of his situation, overwhelmed by his belief in §GRoman revival§!. §RHis regime grows shakier everyday, with opponents on all sides plotting his demise.§! Will Mussolini prove himself the heir to Augustus, or will the Ides of March come?§!"

 Vendetta_Nazionale:0 "Vendetta Nazionale"
 Vendetta_Nazionale_desc:0 "Since the idea of Risorgimento came to being, the Italian people were always filled with nationalist vigor. The Austrians were the bogeyman of Italian liberation, who must be expelled from our homeland! With these words Victor Emmanuel II attacked Austria with Prussian aid in 1866. But the war was a catastrophe. The oppressive Austrian bastards robbed us of Lombardy, Italian land since the days of Rome. Again we fought in the Europakrieg, again we were betrayed by Russia, and forced to withdraw from our rightful land. Despite the bloodshed, despite betrayal, Italy will rise. Our nation will be free and glorious forever, we will destroy Austria and all of Italy’s enemies! Viva Italia! Morte a Austria! Viva il Duce!"

 Stuck_Past:0 "Stuck in the Past"
 Stuck_Past_desc:0 "The Royal Italian Army was established during the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy. During the early 1800s, we began slowly our general Manfredo Fanti signed a creation decree which created the Army of the Two Sicilies. When the Bruderkrieg was around, our new army was barely tested as we signed an early peace treaty with the treacherous Austrians in order for some of our true lands. Over the years we built a strong army based around the principles of War of Attrition and Cavalry.\n\nWe tried again attacking the Austrians in the Europa Krieg, but that paid little due. At the Battle of Padua , our army was outmaneuvered and crushed by the far superior Austrian generals, whose tactics and technology easily pushed us back. Despite us making gains, it was minor compared to the Russian and Prussian efforts, and our front completely collapsed when the Russians pulled out. In the end, we lost hundreds of thousands of men for small swaths of land. Our army is weak and useless compared to our allies and enemies, and must be examined."

 ITA_mafia_idea:0 "The South in Tatters"
 ITA_mafia_idea_desc:0 "Once upon a time the South was the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, which rallied valiantly under the heroic Garibaldi to free Italy from oppression. Hope and enthusiasm blossomed in Southern Italy, which the King promised to restore and glorify. 75 years later, and that hope is gone.\n\nIt started with the Third War of Italian Independence. Italians across the peninsula rallied to break the hated Austrians and to free Venice. With the cry of, “Primo Venezia Poi Roma!”, the Southerners eagerly rallied to the House of Savoy. Hundreds of thousands of Italians fought and died for Venice, and instead the King sacrificed Lombardy for peace. The Southern spirit was dented, but not broken. Next the new King, Victor Emmanuel III, promised vengeance. Italy would be free! This time, with all Europe by our side, we would prevail against Austrian tyranny! The South watched in horror as the Northern fields first went fallow and then burned, as the flower of their manhood fell at Padua thanks to the incompetence of Cadorna and the officers, and in fear as the King called to us. Still we answered the call, with the Levy of ‘99, and watched as again, the King sacrificed hundreds of thousands of boys, for they were just 18, for naught. At the peace, Italy was denied even Lombardy, as were our only faithful allies, the Prussians, both of us betrayed by the great menacing bear of the East. But our wrath was reserved not for Russia, but the King. Fool us once, shame on him. Fool us twice, shame on us. The dreams of Garibaldi were dead. The economy, already in bad shape compared to the North, lay in tatters.\n\nIn this state, it was not surprising that veterans turned to crime. Huge crime networks soon lorded over Sicily, and the cynical South accepted it. The Cosa Nostra even enjoyed popular support because they were the one organization that offered security and peace. Finally the South could rest, and was it really not worth the money?\n\nThe South’s economy is a broken relic of the past. Its politics are defined by cynicism and the mafia. But perhaps the fire still burns. Perhaps the South will still fight for Italy. Perhaps the South’s problems would be fixed. But then again, it would take a great leader indeed to do that..."

 ITA_socialist_revolt:0 "Incoming Socialist Revolution"
 ITA_socialist_revolt_desc:0 "The Year was 1917. The Europa Krieg had ended, and the people around Europe were celebrating around Europe...but in Italy the situation was different. There were massive riots against the King Victor Emanuel III, calling for his abdication. The people were flocking to the extreme ideologies. The National Fascists under activist Benito Mussolini and Socialists and Marxists under Fenruccio Parri and student Antonio Gramsci all vied for power in the government. In what became known as the Siege of Pitti Palace, hundreds of thousands of Italian fascists and nationalists under the organized rule of Mussolini, not just from Florence, rioted outside the Florentine castle demanding the king resign. The King, fearing a secession from the socialists and fascists and a total collapse of Italy, who were mainly concentrated in the North, appointed Mussolini to enact a series of purges and centralize Italy.\n\nLa Grande Rinascita were a series of purges and arrests enacted by Mussolini against the group of communists led by Gramsci who often encouraged workers to strike, majorly hurting our economy. But the King demanded Mussolini let Parri go, and not wanting to lose the trust of the King, he left Parri and the Social Democratic Party off the hook.\n\nTo this day, the workers of Northern Italy bide their time, waiting for an organized coalition to overthrow the fascist government. Parri secretly continues to inspire them in his newspaper with promises of healthcare and higher wages, while Mussolini flatters the Italian bourgeoisie and nobility and futurists to enforce his regime. The revolutionary clock is ticking towards midnight every day...\n\n§RWe must watch our backs!§!"

 ITA_victor_emmanuel:0 "Victor Emanuel's Loyalty"
 ITA_victor_emmanuel_desc:0 "The King’s relationship with Mussolini, is to put it simply, shaky. He views Mussolini as oft dangerous to his rule, and one who might be secretly planning behind his back. Therefore, he has started relying heavily on other members of the right, like the eccentric but extremely loyal Julius Evola.\n\nBorn in Rome, Evola has worked his way up to the top of the government, and has gained favor with the King. Like Victor Emanuel and Mussolini, he wants to reform the Roman Empire. If he gets too much influence over the king than Mussolini, he can launch a countercoup with the King’s support. Now...who should we side with?"

ITA_starting_tree_events.1.d:0 "Italy’s people have not been kind to their nation. On the brink of a revolution, the government waits, with cliques and soldiers taking arms, no one can tell how this will end. The fighting is between two blurred sides. The right with the current government and army, and the left with socialism and the people. This can never end bloodless.\n\nThe right is barely unified, with the thought of order being the only uniting figure. Men like Evola and his cabinet want a state of madness. His pagan ideals and occult ideas have no holdings within the people. Then, there is Mussolini. He stays the puppet master, waiting like a cat to pounce. The right overall needs its wits to make this situation work in their favor.\n\nThe left is a much stronger front. The two parties working towards this being powerhouses politically and holding the ire of the population and the world. The left is split between two sides, the Orthodox Communist Party, and the Unitary Party. The OCP aims for a world revolution, hoping to work more aligned with those of the world. There seems to be no central leadership, though many aim for control. The UP seemingly wants a more democratic approach, wanting to unite Italy with freedom and the ideals of democratic socialism.\n\nOnce upon a time, the great Roman Empire went through difficult times, yet they prevailed. And whether it be for the revolution or for the fasces, so shall we."

ITA_mafia_idea_2:0 "The South in Tatters"
 ITA_mafia_idea_2_desc:0 "Once upon a time the South was the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, which rallied valiantly under the heroic Garibaldi to free Italy from oppression. Hope and enthusiasm blossomed in Southern Italy, which the King promised to restore and glorify. 75 years later, and that hope is gone.\n\nIt started with the Third War of Italian Independence. Italians across the peninsula rallied to break the hated Austrians and to free Venice. With the cry of, “Primo Venezia Poi Roma!”, the Southerners eagerly rallied to the House of Savoy. Hundreds of thousands of Italians fought and died for Venice, and instead the King sacrificed Lombardy for peace. The Southern spirit was dented, but not broken. Next the new King, Victor Emmanuel III, promised vengeance. Italy would be free! This time, with all Europe by our side, we would prevail against Austrian tyranny! The South watched in horror as the Northern fields first went fallow and then burned, as the flower of their manhood fell at Padua thanks to the incompetence of Cadorna and the officers, and in fear as the King called to us. Still we answered the call, with the Levy of ‘99, and watched as again, the King sacrificed hundreds of thousands of boys, for they were just 18, for naught. At the peace, Italy was denied even Lombardy, as were our only faithful allies, the Prussians, both of us betrayed by the great menacing bear of the East. But our wrath was reserved not for Russia, but the King. Fool us once, shame on him. Fool us twice, shame on us. The dreams of Garibaldi were dead. The economy, already in bad shape compared to the North, lay in tatters.\n\nIn this state, it was not surprising that veterans turned to crime. Huge crime networks soon lorded over Sicily, and the cynical South accepted it. The Cosa Nostra even enjoyed popular support because they were the one organization that offered security and peace. Finally the South could rest, and was it really not worth the money?\n\nThe South’s economy is a broken relic of the past. Its politics are defined by cynicism and the mafia. But perhaps the fire still burns. Perhaps the South will still fight for Italy. Perhaps the South’s problems would be fixed. But then again, it would take a great leader indeed to do that..."
