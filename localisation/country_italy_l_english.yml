  leader_events.1.t:0 "Benito Mussolini"
 leader_events.1.d:0 "Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini was born in Predappio in 1883. Raised by a socialist father and a strongly Catholic mother, he was expelled from most schools he joined for fighting. He immigrated from the Austrian Empire to Italy by way of Young Italy, and soon became editor of the highly popular leftist newspaper, Avanti! However, the Europakrieg turned him against the left after he was expelled from the PSI for his nationalist support for the war, and he began organizing bands of nationalistic youth into Squadristi divisions who supported the army during the war, agitating fiercely against the old aristocratic officers, and then suppressing leftist protests against the war. Through all this, Mussolini railed against the traitors within and without, and the Austrian devils. It was at this point that he met two men that would define his ideological beliefs: Julius Evola and Filippo Marinetti. Mussolini dovetailed Evola’s radical, occultist traditionalism with Marinetti’s radical, atheist futurism to produce an ideology glorifying war, strength, and the Italian nation.\nWith the war concluding in a humiliating betrayal of Italy, Mussolini’s followers railed against the Left, and the North was a warzone for the so-called Bienna Rossa. This chaos ended when Mussolini personally seized control of Florence. The King negotiated with him, and Mussolini gave up many of his futurist principles to gain power as prime minister - a decision that would cause a falling out with Marinetti. The King and Mussolini began a correspondence, which was always quite cold, as the King never forgave Mussolini for his republican speeches during the Bienna Rossa and Mussolini never intended to permanently allow a separate power base to develop. But, unbeknownst to him, that was exactly what was happening, as his old friend Evola struck up a friendship with the King, who, while not sold on certain occultist beliefs of Evola, agreed with his radical traditionalist ideas.\nMussolini, unaware of the defection of his old friends, settled into government. It took him little time to dispense with the facade democracy, as the Grand Fascist Council superseded Parliament and then the Acerbo Law granted Mussolini full control over it. The main threat to Mussolini was the socialists, who were divided into two camps - Radicals led by Antonio Gramsci and Moderates led by Ferrucio Parri.\n Mussolini initiated La Rinascita, ostensibly a program to promote Italian culture and nationalism but really to eliminate socialists. Gramsci was driven into exile and the massively popular socialist leader Giacomo Matteoti was assassinated. The assassination of Matteoti sparked outrage and riots that caused the King to contemplate dismissing him, but Evola convinced him that giving in to the Reds would make more trouble than Mussolini. However, the King, perhaps fearing the socialist reaction, or perhaps looking to plant the seeds of Mussolini’s overthrow, forbade Mussolini from going after the Moderates, and Mussolini reluctantly agreed. In the following years, under pressure from the King, parties that agreed to “non-violence”, a doctrine that in essence enforced obedience to the MSVN, the organized version of the old Fasci, were allowed to operate, with Parri forming a new, hugely popular, Democratic People’s Party and liberal leader Ivanoe Bonomi restoring the Liberal Party. Despite the appearance of reforms, “democracy” will never threaten Mussolini so long as the Acerbo Law stands.\nPerhaps Il Duce hoped that these reforms would cement his rule. Instead, the cracks continued to spread, everywhere. Mussolini, perhaps naively, trusted that the King would not make a move against him, while the King and Evola were plotting a long-term strategy to make the latter Prime Minister. The initial fascist economic boom was broken as the ideological combination of futurism, syndicalism, and corporatism did not make for a stable economy. Parri’s supporters only grew more vocal, and the MSVN could scarcely contain them anymore. The only place where Mussolini gained strength was from the Liberals, from which he co-opted rightists opposed to Bonomi’s budding alliance with Parri. But by far the greatest threat for Mussolini was in his own party, dividing into four main factions. The first and oldest were the Futurists, who were enraged at Mussolini for compromising with the establishment. The next was Evola’s wing of the party, which while feigning loyalty to Mussolini was planning his downfall with the King. The third were conservatives and business interests who had only joined the party to stave off the Reds, and had no loyalty not just to Il Duce, but to fascism itself. Only the fourth, incompetent party men personally loyal to Il Duce, could be counted on. Despite this, he still had broad popular support, and in general Mussolini’s support was far greater than Parri’s.\nIn 1936, Mussolini remains blissfully unaware of his situation, overwhelmed by his own rhetoric of a glorious Roman revival. His regime sits on the head of a pin, with opponents overtly and covertly plotting his demise. Will Mussolini prove himself to be the heir to Augustus, or meet the fate of Julius Caesar?"

 Vendetta_Nazionale:0 "Vendetta Nazionale"
 Vendetta_Nazionale_desc:0 "Since the idea of Risorgimento came to being, the Italian people were always filled with nationalist vigor. The Austrians were the bogeyman of Italian liberation, who must be expelled from our homeland! With these words Victor Emmanuel II attacked Austria with Prussian aid in 1866. But the war was a catastrophe. The oppressive Austrian bastards robbed us of Lombardy, Italian land since the days of Rome. Again we fought in the Europakrieg, again we were betrayed by Russia, and forced to withdraw from our rightful land. Despite the bloodshed, despite betrayal, Italy will rise. Our nation will be free and glorious forever, we will destroy Austria and all of Italy’s enemies! Viva Italia! Morte a Austria! Viva il Duce!"

 Stuck_Past:0 "Stuck in the Past"
 Stuck_Past_desc:0 "The Royal Italian Army was established during the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy. During the early 1800s, we began slowly our general Manfredo Fanti signed a creation decree which created the Army of the Two Sicilies. When the Bruderkrieg was around, our new army was barely tested as we signed an early peace treaty with the treacherous Austrians in order for some of our true lands. Over the years we built a strong army based around the principles of War of Attrition and Cavalry.\n\nWe tried again attacking the Austrians in the Europa Krieg, but that paid little due. At the Battle of Padua , our army was outmaneuvered and crushed by the far superior Austrian generals, whose tactics and technology easily pushed us back. Despite us making gains, it was minor compared to the Russian and Prussian efforts, and our front completely collapsed when the Russians pulled out. In the end, we lost hundreds of thousands of men for small swaths of land. Our army is weak and useless compared to our allies and enemies, and must be examined."

 ITA_mafia_idea:0 "The South in Tatters"
 ITA_mafia_idea_desc:0 "Once upon a time the South was the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, which rallied valiantly under the heroic Garibaldi to free Italy from oppression. Hope and enthusiasm blossomed in Southern Italy, which the King promised to restore and glorify. 75 years later, and that hope is gone.\nIt started with the Third War of Italian Independence. Italians across the peninsula rallied to break the hated Austrians and to free Venice. With the cry of, “Primo Venezia Poi Roma!” (First Venice then Rome), the Southerners eagerly rallied to the House of Savoy. As a French general witnessing the Europakrieg would say later, “All the courage in the world cannot prevail against gunfire,” and so it was with our men. Hundreds of thousands of Italians fought and died for Venice, and instead the King sacrificed Lombardy for peace. The Southern spirit was dented, but not broken. Next the new King, Victor Emmanuel III, promised vengeance. Italy would be free! This time, with all Europe by our side, we would prevail against Austrian tyranny! The South watched in horror as the Northern fields first went fallow and then burned, as the flower of their manhood fell at Padua thanks to the incompetence of Cadorna and the officers, and in fear as the King called to us. Still we answered the call, with the Levy of ‘99, and watched as again, the King sacrificed hundreds of thousands of boys, for they were just 18, for naught. At the peace, Italy was denied even Lombardy, as were our only faithful allies, the Prussians, both of us betrayed by the great menacing bear of the East. But our wrath was reserved not for Russia, but the King. Fool us once, shame on him. Fool us twice, shame on us. The dreams of Garibaldi were dead. The economy, already in bad shape compared to the North, lay in tatters.\nIn this state, it was not surprising that veterans turned to crime. Huge crime networks soon lorded over Sicily, and the cynical South accepted it. The Cosa Nostra even enjoyed popular support because they were the one organization that offered security and peace. Finally the South could rest, and was it really not worth the money?\nThe South’s economy is a broken relic of the past. Its politics are defined by cynicism and the mafia. But perhaps the fire still burns. Perhaps the South will still fight for Italy. Perhaps the South’s problems would be fixed. But then again, it would take a great leader indeed to do that..."

 ITA_socialist_revolt:0 "Incoming Socialist Revolution"
 ITA_socialist_revolt_desc:0 "The Year was 1917. The Europa Krieg had ended, and the people around Europe were celebrating in the streets...but in Italy the situation was different. The people were rioting in the streets against Victor Emanuel. They were flocking to the extreme ideologies. The National Fascists under activist Benito Mussolini and Socialists and Marxists under Fenruccio Parri and student Antonio Gramsci all vied for power in the government. In what became known as the Siege of Pitti Palace, hundreds of thousands of Italian fascists and nationalists under the organized rule of Mussolini, not just from Florence, rioted outside the Florentine castle demanding the king resign. The King, fearing a secession from the socialists and fascists and a total collapse of Italy, who were mainly concentrated in the North, appointed Mussolini to enact a series of purges and centralize Italy.\nThe Grando Euparazione are a series of purges and arrests enacted by Mussolini against the L’ordine Nuovo, having been started in 1920, the group of communists led by Gramsci who often encouraged workers to strike, majorly hurting our economy. But the King demanded Mussolini let Parri go, and not wanting to lose the trust of the King, he left Parri and the Social Democratic Party off the hook.\nTo this day, the workers of Northern Italy bide their time, waiting for an organized coalition to overthrow the fascist government. Parri secretly continues to inspire them in his newspaper with promises of healthcare and higher wages, while Mussolini flatters the Italian bourgeoisie and nobility to enforce his regime. The clock is ticking till the revolt...\n§RNot solving this problem will lead to a civil war!§!"

 ITA_victor_emmanuel:0 "Victor Emanuel's Loyalty"
 ITA_victor_emmanuel_desc:0 "The King’s relationship with Mussolini, is to put it simply, shaky. He views Mussolini as oft dangerous to his rule, and one who might be secretly planning behind his back. Therefore, he has started relying heavily on other members of the right, like the eccentric but extremely loyal Julius Evola.\nBorn in Rome, Evola has worked his way up to the top of the government, and has gained favor with the King. Like Victor Emanuel and Mussolini, he wants to reform the Roman Empire. If he gets too much influence over the king than Mussolini, he can launch a countercoup with the King’s support. Now...who should we side with?"
