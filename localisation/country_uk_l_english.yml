  ENG_pact_of_atlantica:0 "Pact of Atlantica Agreement"
  ENG_pact_of_atlantica_desc:0 "In the midst of the chaos of the Europa Krieg on June 15th, 1915, Prime Minister David Lloyd George signed a pact of neutrality in all wars, wanting to have no business with the tyrannies of Europe. The largely anti-war populace of Britain would have no business with the petty feuds of the Austrians or Prussians. The Pact lasted throughout the Europa Krieg, with Norway also being invited when its neighbors Denmark and Sweden crumbled. When the Sino-American split happened over policy in India, America left the Pact, but Norway and the British Federation still hopes to be a bastion of liberty and peace in Europe and the World."


  ENG_broken_crown_jewel:0 "Broken Crown Jewel"
  ENG_broken_crown_jewel_desc:0 "On March 12th, 1930, Mahatma Gandhi and 300 others were shot marching to the shores of Dandhi. It would be one of our biggest mistakes in our long history.\n\nIndia was once our pride and joy. Pumping out riches for the British Empire which spanned the seas, a model of civilized native princes and the divide and rule strategy - truly a symbol for all Britannia! The Jewel in our Crown, India was always our priority number one. Now India has fallen. The Crown Jewel lies in the dust, with only a small loyalist force in Bengal, our first conquest, remaining loyal to the crown. The Empire is all the weaker for it, as it has broken our profits, our alliance with America, and our international credibility.\n\nBut the biggest thing it has destroyed is our morale and cohesion. Far-right Tories demand the resumption of war, far-left Union Laborists demand withdrawal and acceptance, with the National Government under Halifax caught in the middle. Meanwhile, the average Briton lives in poverty on the streets, disgusted or apathetic to democracy in Britain, having lost all hope of carrying the British torch forward. It is a dark night of the soul for Britain and for the Empire.\n\n§RUntil the Raj is recovered and united, our jewel shall remain shattered.§!"


  ENG_british_jingoism:0 "British Jingoism"
  ENG_british_jingoism_desc:0 "The disgraceful display of the great Indian revolt has put Britain to shame, and has stirred up British jingoism and nationalism. Despite the majority of the populace being anti-war and non-interventionist, a small group of colonial bulldogs under the likes of Winston Churchill have tried to rouse up a bigger army on a journey to retake the Raj, depose Jack Lang, and unify South Africa. The British Army is growing large, but how potent these soldiers are is unkown."


  ENG_federalism:0 "The Imperial Federation"
  ENG_federalism_desc:0 "With the current breakdown of the British Raj, we sought to reorganize its rule over our colonies. Some conservatives sought a tighter iron grip should help weaken nationalist movements in their colonies but some would argue that would only accelerate the issue. Thus an age old idea was brought forth once again: The Imperial Federation. A once abandoned idea could be the key to maintaining the Empire. Such an idea was not too alienating as such colonies like Australia, Canada and New Zealand ruled with their own local government with semi-independence, thus still contributing their armies, wealth and support. Such an idea to take it to the next level now seemed necessary to Imperial survival especially to keep up against the other powers of Europe. The Empire is in shambles, and Halifax's Imperial Federation might be our final hope."
