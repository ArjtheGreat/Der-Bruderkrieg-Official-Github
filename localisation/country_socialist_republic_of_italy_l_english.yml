##ideas
CMI_shaky_coalition:0 "Shaky Coalition"
CMI_shaky_coalition_desc:0 "Our coalition is made up off a loose group of leftists ranging from radical socialists like Antonio Gramsci to moderate social democrats like Fenrucco Parri. While all members want to overthrow the totatlitarian fascist regime under the tyrants Benito Mussolini and Victor Emanuel III, the coalition still has not reached a common ground on what can happen after we have freed Italy.\n\nShould we go for a more interventionist, aggressive stance and side with the Marxists, or a more diplomatic and secretive stance when supporting Parri's PDP. The fate of Italy lies in our hands."
CMI_for_a_free_italia:0 "For A Free Italia!"
CMI_for_a_free_italia_desc:0 "Italy has been under the fist of the absolutist House of Savoy since 1861. Long have the common people been oppressed and trapped in poverty while the nobility sips on champagne and dines on fine food. The final straw was Victor Emanuel appointing Mussolini and the passing of the Arcebo Law, esentially banning all democracy. We have been plotting for years to overthrow this autocratic state, and now is our time to finally free Italy. And we shall do whatever it takes to achieve this dream."
CMI_support_of_the_northern_workers:0 "Support of the Northern Workers"
CMI_support_of_the_northern_workers_desc:0 "The northern workers have been the driving force of our revolution, having recognized the faults of the fascist regime and the power of our message. They are the driving force of our economy and we shall make them a centerpiece of our policies, expanding their healthcare and rights. With their support, Italia can become an economic superpower and have the ability to compete with Austria and France."
