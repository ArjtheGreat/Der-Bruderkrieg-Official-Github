  LONG_DESC:0 "Huey 'The Kingfish' Long was at one point a nobody from the rural town of Winnfield about 200 miles northwest of Baton Rouge. But Long didn't stay a nobody forever and very quickly became a well known figure in Louisiana. After attending university he became a skilled and well known lawyer who was known for never taking a case against the poor man.Long’s law skills even caught the attention of WIlliam Howard Taft who said Long was 'the most brilliant lawyer who ever practiced before the United States Supreme Court.' His time as a lawyer saw the beginning of his never ending battle against the Standard oil company of Louisiana. Long was elected to "chair of the Louisiana public service commision' in 1922. In 1924 Long unsuccessfully ran for governor of Louisiana, although he became more well known and would still play a key role in the state's politics. In 1928 Long ran again with the slogan 'Every man a king' and won with the largest voter margin in Louisiana till that point. Long's leadership transformed the once isolated swamp communities of Louisiana to bustling towns connected with real paved roads. Long’s policies of helping the common man boosted him to national stardom.\nLong was governor until 1932. In 1932 Long ran against FDR for the democrat nominee. The race was close but a week before the democratic convention of 1932 an affair FDR was in with a woman was published in the newspaper with photo evidence. Over the previous months FDR’s polio had become worse and was now noticed by the public. This led to Long securing the nomination in a very close 52% win. Long easily beat incumbent President Herbert Hoover winning 58% of the popular vote or 22,377,868 votes  out of the 38,582,531 voters that year. Long won 409 of 531 electoral college votes. Long has since tried to pass multiple massive public relief bills and programs but has experienced fierce resistance from congress. Long’s battle with Standard Oil still continues and despite his best efforts the nation is on fire, battling a polio outbreak, a bad economy and an upcoming election. The 1936 election will decide the fate of Huey Long and America."

The Colombian-American War will be remembered as the day in which America lost its control over the South American states, Colombia ascending onto the broken throne we left behind. Now they control the states through spies, guerillas, and interventions, having the big stick ready to strike at us again. But times have changed, we have become stronger, and our pride will never fall. Uncle Sam will teach Juan Valdez and his mule a lesson, every second that passes, we are getting ready to strike the south again, and this time, we will not fail, never ever again."

America will always be the land of the free and the bastion of liberty, but ever since the embarrassment of the Colombian-American War, the populace has been largely anti war.\nThe Pact lasted throughout the Europa Krieg, but with the horrendous killings of Gandhi and the eventual collapse of India, American and British relations were tarnished.

The Democratic Party had been split into 3 factions during the decisive 1932 elections: the Smith Faction, the Roosvelelt Faction, and the Longist faction. Due to the lasting impacts of the Great Depression and FDR's scandals, Huey had won the initially close primary in a blowout. He had recieved scorn from the likes of Harry Byrd and John Nance Garner. But today, he picked up today's New York Times, the major headline being, "Garner endorses the Kingfish!"\n\nLong put down the phone and got up to go get dressed. He would continue to campaign today in the primaries against Al Smith, but he knew his winning the primary would be far easier with the support of the Roosevelts. Now, it was time to move forward."

Named after Vice President Wallace who wrote the plan in cooperation with Long, the plan consists of a number of bills, executive orders, and government programs that will be focused around helping the agricultural workers and farmers in states affected by the depression and the Dustbowl.

I am sure that Vice President Wallace is the man for the job.The only thing that can ruin this is those snakes in Congress""

USA_wallace_events.2.d:0 "Vice President George Wallace has begun taking action to implement the first part of "The Wallace Plan", which is the "agricultural relief bill". The original idea was to pass a bill that will help relieve farmers in areas hit hardest by the dust bowl in multiple ways, mainly by starting emergency infrastructure projects, distributing food to starving families, and giving farmers free seeds for their farms. But after Wallace tried to pass the bill in Congress it was clear that even if congress Would fully support all stages of the bill, the treasury does not have the spare funds to allow all 3 stages of the bill to pass. Wallace must now choose between building roads connecting the forgotten communities, giving seeds to farmers to continue farming that would otherwise not be able to afford them, or establishing food distribution centers to feed starving families."

Long said during his speech "If you ignorant bastards don’t pass these bills, then I’ll go above you and straight to the supreme court, and if those snakes don’t pass them then I’ll pack the  court to the point where you’d think it’s a can of sardines you buy from the general store.

Both however believe the KKK is and should be labeled as a terrorist organization. The only two Long could find who we’re willing to publicly denounce the klan.

Everybody in attendance tonight, I’d like you to sit and think, look around, tell me, how many of you have had to go hungry into the night with your children because you can't afford a meal, Because those crooks at standard oil, and ford won’t give you a raise. How many of you have had to walk through rocks, glass and mud because your city can’t afford to pave roads" Long later added "If you want grub for your family, If you want paved roads, and warm homes in the winter. Give the plan a chance, it’s not for me, it’s for you and your children" The plan will be steered by a new government agency called the "ERA" or "Economic Reform Administration.""

The only way you’ll ever be able to feed the balance of the people is to make that man come back and bring back some that grub he ain’t got no business with!"

There are 3 main Unions however one of which will be granted special rights in return for more cooperation with the government however co-operation will still continue with the other 2 albeit to a lesser extent.

Long took in the sights of the Lincoln memorial, the Washington Monument and even admired the Capitol building for what it represented rather than just where he went to work and yelled at senators.

Long continued "So what does this mean you ask? Well no more food limits, buy all you want we got plenty to go around, and we can officially sponsor more businesses as we all have the money nowadays. And the next question of course is, "But Huey what are you gonna do now" well, first I’m gonna sit down and eat and then we’ll see about the rest" The crowd gave a small laugh and many champagne glasses were raised.

 USA_the_banana_war:0 "The Untied Fruit Company"
 USA_the_banana_war_desc:0 "The United Fruit Company was formed with the merger of Minor C. Keith's banana-trading and Andrew W. Preston's Boston Fruit Company. It has slowly been gaining land in Central America and has been gaining more and more influence in the state. Yet the current Sandinista leader has been reluctant to let them play a bigger role, so it is our job to make sure the people know of the clear benefits of United Fruit investment. With Central American Elections coming up soon, we hope to get our candidate Francisco Javier Arana in power.\n\nCurrently, our influence in Centro-American politics is §Y[?CEN_USA_Influence]§! out of 1000.\n\n§CIf we secure a high enough influence, our candidate will be elected and we will control all Central American activities.§!"
