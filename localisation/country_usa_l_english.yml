  DBK_USA_DESC:0 "The last few decades have been a challenging few for the United States. After Theodore Roosevelt won re-election in 1912 under the progressive parties, the US was supposed to embark upon creating a bright future, staying out of the Europakrieg. The US experienced a growing middle class under Theodore Roosevelt’s progressive policies until Warren G. Harding’s mass removal of progressive regulations resulted in an economic collapse in 1924. Fast forward 12 years and after multiple failed attempts, incumbent president Huey Long thinks he may finally have the solution to the depression. The upcoming 1936 election will decide if he will have the opportunity to prove it. Ridden with polio, economic ruin and the dust bowl, dark times may lay ahead for the United States."

  LONG_DESC:0 "Huey 'The Kingfish' Long was at one point a nobody from the rural town of Winnfield about 200 miles northwest of Baton Rouge. But Long didn't stay a nobody forever and very quickly became a well known figure in Louisiana. After attending university he became a skilled and well known lawyer who was known for never taking a case against the poor man.Long’s law skills even caught the attention of WIlliam Howard Taft who said Long was 'the most brilliant lawyer who ever practiced before the United States Supreme Court.' His time as a lawyer saw the beginning of his never ending battle against the Standard oil company of Louisiana. Long was elected to "chair of the Louisiana public service commision' in 1922. In 1924 Long unsuccessfully ran for governor of Louisiana, although he became more well known and would still play a key role in the state's politics. In 1928 Long ran again with the slogan 'Every man a king' and won with the largest voter margin in Louisiana till that point. Long's leadership transformed the once isolated swamp communities of Louisiana to bustling towns connected with real paved roads. Long’s policies of helping the common man boosted him to national stardom.\n\nLong was governor until 1932. In 1932 Long ran against FDR for the democrat nominee. The race was close but a week before the democratic convention of 1932 an affair FDR was in with a woman was published in the newspaper with photo evidence. Over the previous months FDR’s polio had become worse and was now noticed by the public. This led to Long securing the nomination in a very close 52% win. Long easily beat incumbent President Herbert Hoover winning 58% of the popular vote or 22,377,868 votes  out of the 38,582,531 voters that year. Long won 409 of 531 electoral college votes. Long has since tried to pass multiple massive public relief bills and programs but has experienced fierce resistance from congress. Long’s battle with Standard Oil still continues and despite his best efforts the nation is on fire, battling a polio outbreak, a bad economy and an upcoming election. The 1936 election will decide the fate of Huey Long and America."

The Democratic Party had been split into 3 factions during the decisive 1932 elections: the Smith Faction, the Roosvelelt Faction, and the Longist faction. Due to the lasting impacts of the Great Depression and FDR's scandals, Huey had won the initially close primary in a blowout. He had recieved scorn from the likes of Harry Byrd and John Nance Garner. But today, he picked up today's New York Times, the major headline being, "Garner endorses the Kingfish!"\n\nLong put down the phone and got up to go get dressed. He would continue to campaign today in the primaries against Al Smith, but he knew his winning the primary would be far easier with the support of the Roosevelts. Now, it was time to move forward."

But after Wallace tried to pass the bill in Congress it was clear that even if congress Would fully support all stages of the bill, the treasury does not have the spare funds to allow all 3 stages of the bill to pass.

Smith is the first Catholic President, something that drew a crowd of angry Americans to raise a skirmish Smith supporters attending the ceremony. Smith took to the microphone to reassure the crowd, repeating his promise to rid the US of Prohibition and create vital jobs. Smith also mentioned his promises to not turn the US into a welfare state in pursuit of ending the depression; the government would stay limited in spending. William Gibbs McAdoo, a Wilsonian democrat, is now vice president as a compromise to keep the Democrat Party united. Some think however that McAdoo will just get in the way. One thing is certain, Smith’s presidency is sure to be an interesting one."

USA_borah_victory.1.d:0 "Today in Washington D.C William Borah took his first oath of office to become the President of the United States. A medium sized crowd was in attendance. Borah laid out his plans to work with the Bull Moose Party to pass progressive legislation and defeat conservative Democrats in Congress. Borah voiced his plans to lower government spending where it isn’t needed and raising it where it is. This includes plans to lower the wages of governors, senators and representatives. Borah however raised tensions with the crowd after re affirming his belief in Prohibition. Former President Huey P. Long was in attendance and said some kind words about Borah, stating he will cooperate as long as it is for the good of the country. Borah’s Liberal Republicans have won the presidency but whether or not they can achieve anything is still a question only time can answer."

Our party has been especially divided since the times of our former presidential nominee Woodrow Wilson. Wilson guided a significant chunk of our party back to our parties very conservative roots, especially when it comes to racial theory and the legacy of the Confederacy. Truly deciding our identity could take the next few decades but these next 4 years will ultimately prove the most signifcant in the long run.\n\nWith Al Smith winning the election, we have a solid base to now build the future upon. Smith in hopes of uniting both the moderate conservatives and Wilsonians as they call themselves has called for a large conference with every major Democrat in the nation to take place at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in New York City a week from today. The location of the conference itself has drawn some controversy from the Wilsonians as many of them view holding the conference in an urban environment in the north completely disregards the parties history.

It is also said that drunken brawls have occurred inside the conference as multiple representatives from the party have reportedly snuck in alcohol despite some being supporters of prohibition. This madness has drawn both the progressives under former president Huey Long and the Republicans to refer to the conference as the “brawl of the asses” a reference to the party's staple donkey logo.\n\nHowever despite all this, Vice-President William Gibbs Mcadoo, a wilsonian who was chosen for vice president as a compromise for the party earlier this year has reportedly begun lobbying support for a compromise that would see him handle the presidents social policies while the president instead focuses on the depression.

A small number of the Wilsonians that left the conference early are supposedly leaving the party and attempting to form a new party however it is unlikely to gain any real momentum and most of the walk out politicians are expected to come crawling back to the Democratic party. While many speculate that if President Smith accepted the proposal it would’ve just delayed this inevitable split after years of growing rifts in the party but that is neither here nor there.

USA_democratic_schism_events.11.d:0 "Former President Huey Long has largely left the public eye after being defeated by Al Smith in the 1936 election except for a few brief appearances. Three of those appearances being on the radio in opposition to Al Smith’s decision to give McAdoo control over the administrations racial policies, saying “If you just woulda declined their compromise those bastards woulda had no place else to go”. Long has come back into the public eye in light of the current mess in Richmond saying “McAdoo is one of them imperial bastards in disguise, this filth has be ridden of” in reference of McAdoo’s strange friendly relationship with the Klu Klux Klan despite not being an official known member. Long has asked; like Coughlin, for as many of his supporters and members of the Bull Moose Progressive party to go and protest the Vice-President's speech tomorrow. Long also addressed the issue of his former ties with Gerald L.K Smith in relation to Long’s “Share our Wealth society” and Smith’s stint as Long’s national organizer, Long saying “Smith has lost his goddam marbles, he’s a no good bastard these days, his family oughta be ashamed! And dam McAdoo for bringing someone as crazy as Smith on a stage!”. Long will be going with his followers to protest the speech reportedly already boarding a plane to fly to Richmond."

USA_democratic_schism_events.12.d:0 "As the clock strikes midnight the streets of Richmond are desolate, quiet and somewhat peaceful. At 12:30 this all changed. The first of the groups expected to appear for Vice-Presidents McAdoo’s Speech tomorrow have begun to arrive, starting off with the Klu Klux Klan. A small portion of the group around 1,000 strong has begun marching through the streets with torches in hand. Reports are already coming out that men associated with the group have set up multiple burning crosses around the city in predominantly black areas. At 12:50 the city was again hit by storm as a mix of Long, Coughlin and Bull Moose party supporters all marched into the city, almost immediately violent clashes between the groups and the KKK erupted that have led to 2 cases of shots fired, one reported stabbing and a molotov cocktail being thrown that led to a apartment building burning down that was thankfully vacant. As more and more people arrive these tensions are likely to only get worse. As Huey Long has arrived in the city there is sure to be a counter rally in protest against McAdoo. Coughlin has also rented a home in the outskirts of Richmond with the intention of protesting the Speech tomorrow. W.E.B Du Bois and multiple other African American civil rights activists from various organizations including the NAACP will be there as well in hopes of protesting and ending the speech before it begins.Whatever happens, it’ll be messy. McAdoo residing in a local 5 star hotel dials the phone and says “Mr. Stephenson, this is McAdoo, we have a problem. 3 men specifically”"

The various factions that have rallied in Richmond in opposition to the speech have not contributed much in the way of cooling tensions. Things though now have quieted down, no doubt it’ll be hectic again soon as McAdoo’s rally is just a few hours away. Wait, what in the hell…..."

In a hotel room downtown, fresh bullet holes and gun smoke riddle a luxurious hotel room, blood pools on the floor but with nobody in sight. There is no doubt who is behind this. Vice-President McAdoo picks up his phone, dials a number, takes a sip of water before the phone is answered."

Not only Charles Coughlin but also famous black civil rights activist W.E.B Du Bois was found hanging from a tree in the Carver neighborhood of Richmond where he was staying, also with the intention of protesting McAdoo’s speech. Even more shocking is Former President Huey P. Long’s hotel room in the Jefferson Hotel has been found riddled with bullet holes, and practically coated with blood but the whereabouts of the Kingfish are unknown. It is unknown how anyone got past Long’s security. But a small piece of cloth with a red cross on it left on the floor ties the attack to the lynching of Charles Coughlin and Du Bois. both of whom we’re found next to burning crosses. It is clear who is behind the attacks. There are other reports of multiple local politicians and prominent citizens also being hung and murdered but the estimate is unknown but above 5. President Smith, similar to the last few days hasn’t commented on the situation and has apparently locked himself in the oval office with only his most trusted secret service members. McAdoo is apparently asleep according to a staff member."

USA_democratic_schism_events.16.d:0 "Vice President McAdoo has recently begun lobbying support to have statues commemorating Confederate Generals, Politicians, soldiers and values put up. To most this is seen as a cheap attempt at historical revision to make the Confederates be looked upon in a better light than they are, but in white southern communities the movement has taken off, mostly thanks to the support of the already predominant “Daughters of the confederacy” organization that succeeded in putting up multiple statues commemorating confederate war heroes. McAdoo also spoke out against the “one sided arrogance” directed towards the Confederacy in US schools and unveiled plans to overhaul that aspect of the education system."
