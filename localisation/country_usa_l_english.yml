  LONG_DESC:0 "Huey 'The Kingfish' Long was at one point a nobody from the rural town of Winnfield about 200 miles northwest of Baton Rouge. But Long didn't stay a nobody forever and very quickly became a well known figure in Louisiana. After attending university he became a skilled and well known lawyer who was known for never taking a case against the poor man.Long’s law skills even caught the attention of WIlliam Howard Taft who said Long was 'the most brilliant lawyer who ever practiced before the United States Supreme Court.' His time as a lawyer saw the beginning of his never ending battle against the Standard oil company of Louisiana. Long was elected to "chair of the Louisiana public service commision' in 1922. In 1924 Long unsuccessfully ran for governor of Louisiana, although he became more well known and would still play a key role in the state's politics. In 1928 Long ran again with the slogan 'Every man a king' and won with the largest voter margin in Louisiana till that point. Long's leadership transformed the once isolated swamp communities of Louisiana to bustling towns connected with real paved roads. Long’s policies of helping the common man boosted him to national stardom.\nLong was governor until 1932. In 1932 Long ran against FDR for the democrat nominee. The race was close but a week before the democratic convention of 1932 an affair FDR was in with a woman was published in the newspaper with photo evidence. Over the previous months FDR’s polio had become worse and was now noticed by the public. This led to Long securing the nomination in a very close 52% win. Long easily beat incumbent President Herbert Hoover winning 58% of the popular vote or 22,377,868 votes  out of the 38,582,531 voters that year. Long won 409 of 531 electoral college votes. Long has since tried to pass multiple massive public relief bills and programs but has experienced fierce resistance from congress. Long’s battle with Standard Oil still continues and despite his best efforts the nation is on fire, battling a polio outbreak, a bad economy and an upcoming election. The 1936 election will decide the fate of Huey Long and America."

  USA_broken_continental_heg_desc:0 "With death, pain, blood, and sweat we fought, but lost. A shining hope we had, an easy battle, but destiny played its cards, and our hegemony broke in half. The Colombian-American War will be remembered as the day in which America lost its control over the South American states, Colombia ascending onto the broken throne we left behind. Now they control the states through spies, guerillas, and interventions, having the big stick ready to strike at us again. But times have changed, we have become stronger, and our pride will never fall. Uncle Sam will teach Juan Valdez and his mule a lesson, every second that passes, we are getting ready to strike the south again, and this time, we will not fail, never ever again."

America will always be the land of the free and the bastion of liberty, but ever since the embarrassment of the Colombian-American War, the populace has been largely anti war.\nThe Pact lasted throughout the Europa Krieg, but with the horrendous killings of Gandhi and the eventual collapse of India, American and British relations were tarnished. Congress voted out of the agreement, but its impact still overshadows US foriegn policy today. Will Long continue what Wilson started, or go on a more aggressive path?"

  USA_prohibition_desc:0 "The eighteenth amendment was passed in 1919 by Theodore Roosevelt’s progressive party in the hopes of making America a purer nation. Widely unpopular among the general population but supported by politicians. The debate for prohibition has raised many eyebrows as how to legally enforce it and how to prevent the rise in organized crime as a result. Huey Long and Al Smith both support the repealment of the amendment while the republican William Bora supports stricter enforcement. Both options will be controversial but a side must be picked.\n\n§RThe Mafia isn't happy...§!"

Widely supported by Southern Democrats and the Klu Klux Klan but widely opposed by Huey Long and the republicans. Tensions are rising and the government must choose a stance that will most likely be the result of the 1936 election.\n\n§RThe Klan will strike its next blow soon...§!"

  USA_great_depression_desc:0 "Following the war with Colombia in the earlier portion of this century the New York stock exchange crashed, causing the highest poverty rates the US has ever seen. After 20 years we still haven’t recovered. Most Americans are out of a job, struggling to make ends meet and close to starvation. Long was elected on his policy of economic aid, rural investment and public works programs. Here in 1936 Long is finally making progress in his breakthrough to implement his policies 4 years after his election. With new candidates racing in support of different policies such as William Borah’s Coolidge-esque de-regulation policies and Al Smith’s anti New Deal approach this election will decide how the economy of America could be changed forever. With it having been 20 years since the beginning of the depression many presidents have tried to solve the problem. So far none have succeeded. "

Coated in dirt and dust, the situation was bad enough, it hasn't helped that this year the middle of our nation has encountered record amounts of powerful wind gusts. These winds have now blown the dust all across the nation, this has wreaked havoc upon the populations and economies of multiple states. Thousands of farmers are leaving their home states of Oklahoma, Colorado, Texas and Kansas to look for new land and homes specifically a large amount have been going to California in hopes of rebuilding their lives"

Only a couple days after his big speech, the first of his reelection campaign, Democratic Party leaders who had once clashed with Long over his rivalry with consertatives and the late Franklin Delano Roosevelt were now throwing their full support behind Long. The Democratic Party had been split into 3 factions during the decisive 1932 elections: the Smith Faction, the Roosvelelt Faction, and the Longist faction. Due to the lasting impacts of the Great Depression and FDR's scandals, Huey had won the initially close primary in a blowout. He had recieved scorn from the likes of Harry Byrd and John Nance Garner. But today, he picked up today's New York Times, the major headline being, "Garner endorses the Kingfish!"\n\nLong put down the phone and got up to go get dressed. He would continue to campaign today in the primaries against Al Smith, but he knew his winning the primary would be far easier with the support of the Roosevelts. Now, it was time to move forward."

  USA_wallace_events.2.d:0 "Vice President George Wallace has begun taking action to implement the first part of "The Wallace Plan", which is the "agricultural relief bill". The original idea was to pass a bill that will help relieve farmers in areas hit hardest by the dust bowl in multiple ways, mainly by starting emergency infrastructure projects, distributing food to starving families, and giving farmers free seeds for their farms. But after Wallace tried to pass the bill in Congress it was clear that even if congress Would fully support all stages of the bill, the treasury does not have the spare funds to allow all 3 stages of the bill to pass. Wallace must now choose between building roads connecting the forgotten communities, giving seeds to farmers to continue farming that would otherwise not be able to afford them, or establishing food distribution centers to feed starving families."
