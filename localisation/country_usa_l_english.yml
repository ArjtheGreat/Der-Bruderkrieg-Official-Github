  LONG_DESC:0 "Huey 'the kingfish' Long was at one point a nobody from the rural town of Winnfield about 200 miles northwest of Baton Rouge. But Long didn't stay a nobody forever and very quickly became a well known figure in Louisiana. After attending university he became a skilled and well known lawyer who was known for never taking a case against the poor man.Long’s law skills even caught the attention of WIlliam Howard Taft who said Long was 'the most brilliant lawyer who ever practiced before the United States Supreme Court.' His time as a lawyer saw the beginning of his never ending battle against the Standard oil company of Louisiana. Long was elected to “chair of the Louisiana public service commision' in 1922. In 1924 Long unsuccessfully ran for governor of Louisiana, although he became more well known and would still play a key role in the state's politics. In 1928 Long ran again with the slogan 'Every man a king' and won with the largest voter margin in Louisiana till that point. Long's leadership transformed the once isolated swamp communities of Louisiana to bustling towns connected with real paved roads. Long’s policies of helping the common man boosted him to national stardom.\nLong was governor until 1932. In 1932 Long ran against FDR for the democrat nominee. The race was close but a week before the democratic convention of 1932 an affair FDR was in with a woman was published in the newspaper with photo evidence. Over the previous months FDR’s polio had become worse and was now noticed by the public. This led to Long securing the nomination in a very close 52% win. Long easily beat incumbent President Herbert Hoover winning 58% of the popular vote or 22,377,868 votes  out of the 38,582,531 voters that year. Long won 409 of 531 electoral college votes. Long has since tried to pass multiple massive public relief bills and programs but has experienced fierce resistance from congress. Long’s battle with Standard Oil still continues and despite his best efforts the nation is on fire, battling a polio outbreak, a bad economy and an upcoming election. The 1936 election will decide the fate of Huey Long and America."

  USA_broken_continental_heg_desc:0 "With death, pain, blood, and sweat we fought, but lost. A shining hope we had, an easy battle, but destiny played its cards, and our hegemony broke in half. The Colombian-American War will be remembered as the day in which America lost its control over the South American states, Colombia ascending onto the broken throne we left behind. Now they control the states through spies, guerillas, and interventions, having the big stick ready to strike at us again. But times have changed, we have become stronger, and our pride will never fall. Uncle Sam will teach Juan Valdez and his mule a lesson, every second that passes, we are getting ready to strike the south again, and this time, we will not fail, never ever again."

  USA_pact_of_atlantica_desc:0 "In the midst of the chaos of the Europa Krieg on June 15th, 1915, [Insert President Here] and [Insert English Prime Minister Here] signed a pact of neutrality in all wars, wanting to have no business with the tyrannies of Europe. Almost every American was anti war, and has ever been since the embarrassment of the Colombian-American War. [American President] preferring to stick with isolation and sell to both sides instead for mass profit. The Pact lasted throughout the Europa Krieg, and Republicans and Democrats still have kept its terms. Its impact still overshadows US foriegn policy today, and it remains to be seen how this agreement will have an impact on the battle for the Americas. Will Long tear it up, or will he make an attempt to keep peace in the world?"

  USA_prohibition:0 "Prohibition"
  USA_prohibition_desc:0 "The eighteenth amendment was passed in 1919 by Theodore Roosevelt’s progressive party in the hopes of making America a purer nation. Widely unpopular among the general population but supported by politicians. The debate for prohibition has raised many eyebrows as how to legally enforce it and how to prevent the rise in organized crime as a result. Huey Long and Al Smith both support the repealment of the amendment while the republican William Bora supports stricter enforcement. Both options will be controversial but a side must be picked."

  USA_plagued_by_polio_desc:0 "After a significant decrease of polio cases from 1901 to 1919, a massive increase of cases in 1920 has burdened our nation with an unhealthy populace specifically crippling our younger population.15 years since spanish flu left many hospitals and healthcare institutions bankrupt many Americans have nowhere to go for treatment and much of our youth is dying. On top of this many schools are out of funding and many families can not afford the ones that are open. Something must be done "

  USA_era_of_segregation_desc:0 "The civil war ended in 1865 almost 71 years ago since Abraham Lincoln passed the emancipation and yet we still see discrimination and the withholding of rights from African Americans. Widely supported by Southern Democrats and the Klu Klux Klan but widely opposed by Huey Long and the republicans. Tensions are rising and the government must choose a stance that will most likely be the result of the 1936 election."

  USA_great_depression:0 "The Great Depression"
  USA_great_depression_desc:0 "Following the war with Colombia in the earlier portion of this century the New York stock exchange crashed, causing the highest poverty rates the US has ever seen. After 20 years we still haven’t recovered. Most Americans are out of a job, struggling to make ends meet and close to starvation. Long was elected on his policy of economic aid, rural investment and public works programs. Here in 1936 Long is finally making progress in his breakthrough to implement his policies 4 years after his election. With new candidates racing in support of different policies such as William Borah’s Coolidge-esque de-regulation policies and Al Smith’s anti New Deal approach this election will decide how the economy of America could be changed forever. With it having been 20 years since the beginning of the depression many presidents have tried to solve the problem. So far none have succeeded. "
