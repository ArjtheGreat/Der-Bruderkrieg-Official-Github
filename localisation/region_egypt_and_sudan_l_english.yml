 EGY_weltschmerzian_apollonism_desc:0 "Coined by Austrian newspaper Die Presse, it aimed to describe the complex social dynamic of Egypt after the defeat of the Anglo-French Punitive Expidition and the strange blend of ultrarational cynicism and masochistic defeatism that seemed to covet both rich and poor Egyptians. There were many factors to the decadent societal state of Egypt, from its corrupt leadership, to her repeated humiliations in the face of European powers. Despite that, one should always remember that the harder one pushes a ball under water, the more violent it will rebound once it is released."
 EGY_reluctant_arabs_desc:0 "Ever since the advent of Pan-arabism, Egypt has always stood with a pessemistic eye towards its Arab neighbours' passion. With the nationalistic tendencies growing ever louder in Egypt, one can only imagine which way Egypt may choose to take?"
 EGY_the_nile_trumvirate_desc:0 "After the Establishment of the Egyptian Protectorate under the supervision of the United Kingdom, power was relegated to three different seats of power.\n\nThe Sultan, who served as the binding figurehead, the Egyptian Parliament, a rump legislature who in reality were only propped up as a mirage of self-rule. But above these two stand the Executive Cabinet, a British-controlled council where true legislative power over Egypt lay vested"
 EGY_the_two_apathists_desc:0 "There exist a strange dichotomy in the old Breadbasket of the Mediterranean, a battle of two souls whom are different, yet very much the same. Coptic and Arab, Rich and Poor; an miasma of apathy hangs heavy over the black banks of the river Nile"
 EGY_cusp_of_dionysus_desc:0 "The People of Egypt, tired of ineffective rule, and wars of hoplessness have begun to loose faith in the establishment. If not handled with care, she may very well erupt in the flames chaos and frezy."
 EGY_aftermath_of_treaty_of_suez_desc:0 "During the Anglo-French Punitive Expidition the Pashas were forced to sign The Treaty of the Suez, a deal framed to 'protect' Egyptian society and integrity, and boost the local economy. Oh, fools they were to trust them! The Treaty was nothing more than a disaster and a humiliation to Egypt and her people! Not only loosing the Suez to the European vultures, but also having her own riches stolen by greedy barons in exchange for nothing but a perpetual millitary occupation; the lands that have nurtured Egyptians for millenia being treated as nothing but a whore to be used. The fact that this Treaty exist is a detriment to our Egyptian pride..!\n\n...Whatever is left of it."
