        DEN_traitors_of_the_revolution:0 "Traitors of the Revolution!"
       DEN_traitors_of_the_revolution_desc:0 "When our capital was lost to the enemy, what did our “protector” do? He fled the country to a faraway island, putting himself over his people. That was when we took charge, the people in charge for the benefit of the people. But still, even when we help our common people, some are still blinded by the capitalists propaganda. We must re-teach these people, in any way possible, to secure the safety of the nation and the people."

       DEN_inextinguishable_ideals:0 "Inexstinguishable Ideals"
       DEN_inextinguishable_ideals_desc:0 "Alone we lit the torch of revolution, alone we tore off our shackles and overthrew the bourgeoisie, alone we’ve united and alone we now stand in a world that wishes for our demise. But alone we shall defend ourselves, alone we shall repel the enemy of the revolution and alone we shall pass on the torch of revolution. The Revolution shall not be extinguished!"

       DEN_split_in_the_parliament:0 "Split in the Folketing"
       DEN_split_in_the_parliament_desc:0 "The coalition that once united the people against their oppressors is now hanging on by the skin of its teeth. Danmarks Kommunistiske Parti, the DPK and the Revolutionære Socialisters Forbund, the RSF are split on how to run the country in the future. As a result of this infighting several reforms have been stopped in their tracks. If our socialist haven is to be achieved we have to solve this before we are crushed by the capitalists."




    ICE_royal_loyalists:0 "Royal Loyalists"
    ICE_royal_loyalists_desc:0 "Such a tragedy that has struck us. While we were defending our motherland those pesky socialist dogs schemed a plan to exile us, from our own Gods chosen Denmark! Luckily, not all of our subjects were fooled by the traitors, and some are even leaving them to join us in our struggle! Although not everyone coming here to help us have our exact mindset, we all have the same goal, to reclaim the fatherland!"

    ICE_military_parliament:0 "Military Government"
    ICE_military_parliament_desc:0 "Our high ranking officers, commanders and captains have been chosen to help us decide our strategies for taking back our motherland. With these brilliant military strategists we can as quickly as possible achieve our main goal, at the expense of our loyal subjects. While these men of the army might know how to best rout the enemy troops, they are much more inexperienced in handling economic policies."

    ICE_icelandic_populace:0 "Icelandic Populace"
    ICE_icelandic_populace_desc:0 "With our escape from the reds, we found ourselves in a small corner of our kingdom, namely Iceland. Even though most Icelanders like the king, most Icelanders do not like the sudden militarisation of their island. If we don't want to lose the last of our kingdom to a red wave we will have to assure the Icelanders that we're here to help and that we really mean it."

        SWE_bondegat:0 "Bondetåget"
        SWE_bondegat_desc:0 "It was with the support of the rural peasants we could seize power. As thanks for their help we’ve had to make some concessions to the agrarian population. These compromises on our economy have had an impact on our previous industrialization but also granted some stability amongst our people. With some adjustments to our current situation this could potentially turn our now stagnating industry to a booming, agrarian-based system. Or we could curb the working class and force a new industrial system to keep up with the ever growing markets of Europe"
